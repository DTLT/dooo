#Terminal Commands

##View size of folders

Navigate to a folder and then type:

`du -Psckx * | sort -nr`

This will print a list of folders/files ordered by their size. This is useful for troubleshooting what is taking up space in a user's account.

##View all running processes

`ps -auxf`

##Run ClamAV scan on all users

`clamscan -ir /home/*/public_html/ -l /var/log/clamscan.log`

##View activity in MySQL

`watch mysqladmin process`

##View all cron jobs for each user

`for user in $(cut -f1 -d: /etc/passwd); do echo $user; crontab -u $user -l; done`

##List all files (recursive within subfolders) in reverse order of date they were modified

`find . -printf '%T@ %c %p\n' | sort -k 1n,1 -k 7 | cut -d' ' -f2-`

Basically after running this it will spit out a list from oldest to newest files so it's easier to spot if a site that hadn't been changed in a while was hacked.

##Fix Folder and File permissions

`find . -type d -exec chmod 755 {} \;`
`find . -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \;`
