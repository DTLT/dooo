#Software

##cPanel
The [[http://cpanel.net/|cPanel control panel software]] is an industry standard for web hosting. We had experience with cPanel from our years of using Bluehost accounts. During our pilot we used the [[http://www.parallels.com/products/plesk/|Plesk panel software]] due to limited availability for other options with our vendor. We were anxious to make the switch to cPanel when we purchased a dedicated server for the Domain of One's Own project. cPanel is licensed yearly and can be bought directly from cPanel or through many resellers (our vendor included the cost and installation of cPanel in our hosting contract).

cPanel is a core component for providing web hosting. It provides a GUI interface to end users to their domain and hosting allowing them to create subdomains, databases, edit DNS records, create FTP accounts, email addresses, install software, and interact with their files through a file manager. cPanel segregates spaces for individual users so that each student only has access to their own files and databases. cPanel is also extensible with [[http://docs.cpanel.net/twiki/bin/view/SoftwareDevelopmentKit/XmlApi|XML and JSON APIs]].

##WHMCS

[[http://www.whmcs.com/|WHMCS]] is billing and client management software that interfaces directly with cPanel and our domain reseller account to automatically provision user accounts and register domains during signup. Using WHMCS we can track domain expirations and send automated email messages at different points in the signup as well as expiration process. We have themed the front-end to match our Wordpress site and hooked into the software to make a few modifications that prevent a user from registering more than 1 domain. WHMCS has [[http://docs.whmcs.com/Main_Page|great documentation]] and is very extensible. We purchased a one-time license but they also have monthly options.

##Installatron

If you've had web hosting of your own you've likely had some type of "One-Click Installer" for common software like WordPress, Drupal, etc. [[http://installatron.com/|Installatron]] is a plugin that works with cPanel (as well as a few other control panel types) and in our experience it's top of the line. A license can be had either monthly, yearly, or at a one-time cost. The [[http://installatron.com/apps|selection of applications]] is great and the experience of installing one is seamless. But what's really great about Installatron for us is that you can hook into the install function to run custom commands. [[http://installatron.com/developer/customization|Their documentation]] outlines some ways this is useful and how to do it. We use it to install custom plugins and themes in WordPress, set default registration options for MediaWiki to prevent spam, and write custom post type information to our WordPress install about each installation as part of a community site we're building on top of UMW Domains. One of the pitfalls of a decentralized solution like Domain of One's Own is being able to visualize the activity happening across all the disparate spaces. By hooking into install functions to track and aggregate them, it allows us a window into the activity across the server, something we plan to build on in the coming weeks/months to create a community portal for UMW Domains.
