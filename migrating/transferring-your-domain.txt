====== Transferring Your Domain ======
 

Transferring your domain essentially means that you must take over ownership and payment for the domain name that you use. As a part of Domain of One's Own, your domain was registered to UMW and paid for by the University on an annual basis. You will need to become the owner of record and pay the annual fee. 

There are hundreds of companies known as **Domain Registrars** which you can work with to register and pay for your domain. Each of these companies is authorized by ICANN (the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers) to legally register internet domain names. The annual price you pay for your domain depends on the price fixed by the Domain Registrar. Generally speaking, you can expect to pay between $10-$20/year for your domain name. 

Usually, when registering a domain you are given the option to automatically renew that domain every year. The advantage to this is that by providing a payment method to the Registrar, you can ensure that your domain will be automatically renewed and you won't run the risk of losing it. The disadvantage is that you need to remember to keep track of the renewal period so that you don't accidentally end up renewing a domain you don't want anymore.

As you move off of Domain of One's Own, you aren't actually registering a //new// domain -- instead you are transferring an //existing, registered// domain to a new registrar. Here's what you'll need to do to proceed: 

===== Login to the Domain of One's Own Client System =====
You probably haven't logged into this system since the day you registered your domain with Domain of One's Own. You'll need to go to http://umwdomains.com/support and click the **Secure Client Login** button. If you don't remember your password, you can [[https://umwdomains.com/support/pwreset.php|reset your password]] by clicking on the **Request a Password Reset** link. 

===== Unlock your domain =====

By default, all domains on the Domain of One's Own are "locked" to make it harder for your domain to be accidentally or maliciously transferred. 
   - From the main Account Overview screen, go to **Domains** > **My Domains**. {{http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3671/11805885504_95f1d6d6ba_c.jpg}}
   - Click on **Manage Domain** {{http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3814/11805724243_aaf1d09c60_c.jpg}}
   - Click the **Registrar Lock** tab {{http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2841/11805885594_a8101d7f00_c.jpg}}
   - Click **Disable Registrar Lock** {{http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5494/11805470345_c4da711402_c.jpg}}

===== Generate an EPP Code =====
The EPP code is generated by the Domain of One's Own server for you to use to transfer your domain elsewhere. Basically, it provides you with authorization to take the domain to a new registrar.

  -Starting from the Domain management screen where you unlocked your domain, go to **Management Tools > Get EPP Code**. {{http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5548/11806224156_f8a50704ea_c.jpg}}
  -Your code will be automatically generated and emailed to your UMW email address. 

===== Pick a Domain Registrar =====

There are hundreds of these companies, so you should shop around. First, look for a company with an annual price you can afford. Sometimes, companies offer break on certain Top Level Domains (.com, .org, .net, etc.) or offer a discount when you initially transfer a domain to them. 

You may wish to search for reviews about the company to see if customers are generally happy. Some Domain Registrars have developed a bad reputation for trying to "upsell" customers -- by sneaking certain services or options in during the order process that increases the final cost. 

If you're also planning on migrating your files/databases off of Domain of One's Own to a new Web hosting company, you may wish to register your domain through them. Almost all Web hosting companies offer domain registration, and sometimes they will give you a better deal if you manage your domain through them. 

As a starting place, you may wish to review LifeHacker's list of [[http://lifehacker.com/5943452/five-best-domain-name-registrars|Five Best Domain Registrars]]. //Please note that neither UMW nor Domain of One's Own is endorsing any of these companies.// 

At this point, how you proceed will depend upon the steps the Domain Registrar you've chosen requires. Generally speaking you will need to sign up for an account with them and then follow the instructions to transfer a domain to them. At some point in this process, you will be asked for the EPP code in order to complete the transfer. 

===== Point Your Domain to Your Site =====
Taking ownership of your domain is the first step to taking full control of your Domain. In addition, you need to decide what you want people to see when they visit your domain. You may be migrating the site(s) you developed as part of Domain of One's Own to a new Web hosting company. You may be starting from scratch with a new hosting company. Or you may decide to point your domain at a third-party service where you are hosting a Web site, such as Google Sites or WordPress.com. 

Regardless, you will need to tell your new Domain Registrar where to point your domain. Within the domain management interface at the Registrar, you will have options to provide information the **Name Servers** that correspond to the server where your site will live. The information will come in the form of a numerical Web address, such as 123.123.11.22. You will need to discover the address of your site's Name Servers and enter them at your new Registrar.

If you have migrated your site from Domain of One's Own to a new Web hosting company or if you are starting from scratch with a hosting company, you can find out the address of the Name Servers by contacting your new hosting company. Often, this information will be included in a new account email or somewhere in the company's online documentation. 

If you are pointing your domain to a third-party service, you'll need to enter the address of the Name Servers associated with that service. Below are links to helpful articles for some popular services:
