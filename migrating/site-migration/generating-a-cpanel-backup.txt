Whether you plan to migrate your website to another service or you just want to have a local backup of your data, cPanel makes it easy to generate a backup of your account.

<li>To begin you will need to login to your control panel by going to the homepage of UMW Domains and clicking the <strong>Login</strong> button in the top righthand corner.<br /><br /><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3808/9394644932_42072c3f76_c_d.jpg" alt="UMW Domains Login Link" width="800" height="409" /><br /><br /></li>
<li>Login to your control panel using the username and password provided to you in the New Account email you received during the signup process.<br /><br /><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3834/9394646464_cb1e711493_c.jpg" alt="UMW Domains Login Page" width="800" height="709" /><br /><br /></li>
<li>Once logged in you will find the <strong>Backup Manager</strong> located under the Files menu in your control panel.<br /><br /><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7363/11805376673_cbf74d8a33_o.png" alt="UMW Domains Backup Manager" /><br /><br /></li>
<li>The Backup Manager allows you to generate a full backup of all of your data in preparation for migrating off of UMW Domains, but can also be run anytime you wish to have a local copy of your data. Please be aware that backups can take up a large amount of space and should be removed from your account once you have downloaded them. To begin generating a backup click the <strong>Backup</strong> button.<br /><br /><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7358/11805127975_30cd92f15f_c.jpg" alt="UMW Domains Backup Manager" /><br /><br /></li>
<li>In most cases it makes sense to generate a full backup so click <strong>Full Backup</strong> on the next screen.<br /><br /><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3778/11805128055_449d68c3a6_c.jpg" alt="UMW Domains Backup Manager" /><br /><br /></li>
<li>Generating a backup can take anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours. On this screen double-check your email address because the system will email you when your backup is ready for download. If you have FTP access to another service you can choose that option but in most cases it will make sense to have the backup in your home folder, in which case you will come back to this screen to download the backup once it is ready.<br /><br /><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5475/11805376653_8e75ac6151_c.jpg" alt="UMW Domains Backup Manager" /><br /><br /></li>
<li>The backup file you download will be a zip file full of folders. To find out what these files and folders are and how to use the backup take a look at the rest of the [[migrating:site-migration:site-migration|Site Migration]] documentation.<br /><br /></li>
