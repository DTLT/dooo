====== Restoring a cPanel Backup ======

If you've [[migrating:site-migration:generating-a-cpanel-backup|generated a cPanel backup]] of your Home Folder, MySQL Databases, and/or Email Forwarders and Filters you can restore that backup to your existing account or any other webhost that supports the cPanel control panel. This makes it very easy to get your data moved to a new host when you migrate your account away from Domain of One's Own. Here is the process for restoring a backup in cPanel.

 1. To begin you will need to login to Domain of One's Own and navigate to the Dashboard.
 2. Once logged in you will find the Backup Manager located under the Files menu in your control panel. {{http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7363/11805376673_cbf74d8a33_o.png}}
 3. To restore a partial backup that you previously created click the **Restore** button {{http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5522/11841142815_f57d72ae07_c.jpg}}
 4. You'll have the option to choose which backup you're restoring. The Home Directory would be a backup of all files and folders in your account, the MySQL databases are databases used by Wordpress and other software packages, and Email Forwarders & Filters are rules that are setup to forward your email addresses associated with your domain to other addresses. Go ahead and choose which backup you'd like to restore (and if you have multiples you can always come back to this screen). {{http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3784/11841935606_2d734c451c_c.jpg}}
 5. On this final screen you will click **Choose File** to select the backup file from your computer where you have it stored and then click **Upload** to upload the file and restore the contents. The time for the restoration process to complete depends on the size of the backup file and the speed of your internet connection. Once this is done a new window will display the contents of the files that were restored. {{http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3823/11842386706_820b8e78f6_c.jpg}}

This restoration process is available as part of cPanel, a control panel package that is used by many webhosts, and can make the process of migrating your account to a new company simple and efficient. It's also great for restoring files from a backup when something major breaks on your website which is why it's important to regularly grab a backup file of your account.
