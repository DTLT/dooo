#Migrating a Site to Wordpress.com

Many students choose to install Wordpress on their website. The version of Wordpress you run is known as the **self-hosted** version which allows you to install plugins and themes on your own. The benefit of this is that you can make these customizations to your site,  however the self-hosted version of Wordpress requires a web hosting account. [Wordpress.com](http://www.wordpress.com) is a **hosted** version of Wordpress that you can run a site from free of charge. The limitation of this is that you are not able to install your own plugins and themes, however the system does come with several themes and plugins that they make available to users. While a Wordpress.com site is free, if you want to run it on a custom domain such as the one you have with UMW Domains, that is an additional charge. You can find more information about using a custom domain at [http://en.support.wordpress.com/domains/](http://en.support.wordpress.com/domains/). Here is the process of exporting the contents of your site and moving it to [Wordpress.com](http://www.wordpress.com).
