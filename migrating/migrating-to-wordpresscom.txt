#Migrating a Site to WordPress.com

{{ http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2861/11966198766_8e4f2c57a9_m.jpg}}Many students choose to install Wordpress on their website. The version of WordPress you run is known as the **self-hosted** version which allows you to install plugins and themes on your own. The benefit of this is that you can make these customizations to your site,  however the self-hosted version of WordPress requires a web hosting account. [WordPress.com](http://www.wordpress.com) is a **hosted** version of WordPress that you can run a site from free of charge. The limitation of this is that it is ad-supported and you are not able to install your own plugins and themes, however the system does come with several themes and plugins that they make available to users. While a Wordpress.com site is free, if you want to run it on a custom domain such as the one you have with UMW Domains, that is an additional charge. You can find more information about using a custom domain at [http://en.support.wordpress.com/domains/](http://en.support.wordpress.com/domains/). Here is the process of exporting the contents of your site and moving it to [WordPress.com](http://www.wordpress.com).

To get started, login to your WordPress site.

WordPress provides a convenient tool to export all content from your site under the Tools menu. From your admin dashboard navigate to **Tools > Export**

The tool will give you the option to export **All Content** or just **Pages** and/or **Posts**. It is recommended when migrating a full site to choose **All Content**. Click **Download Export File**.

The export file (an XML file) will be downloaded to your computer. You will use this file during the import process next. Go to [Wordpress.com](http://www.wordpress.com) and click **Sign Up**

Enter your name, email address, and choose the subdomain for your site. For now, unless you want to register a **new** domain name, just choose a subdomain. You can later decide to transfer your existing domain to the system if you want to pay for it. You can also choose the free WordPress account at the bottom.

Finalize your site by setting the Title, Tagline, and other options.

To import your existing site go to the Dashboard.

Importing works much in the same way as exporting. You'll go to Tools > Import and select that you're importing from another WordPress site.

During the import process it will also download media from your site as well. Select your XML file from the export we did previously and click the **Upload File and Import** button.

Once the export is completed all your **Posts**, **Pages**, **Media**, and **Comments** will be on your site.
