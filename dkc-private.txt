===== System Access Tutorials =====

==== Domain of One's Own (umw.domains) ====

These are tutorials for system access at umw.domains, the main project website for Domain of One's Own. It runs in WordPress, but is integrated with our hosting system and client management system, allowing you to manage certain aspects of users' accounts

===== Documentation Needed! =====
This is documentation that needs to be written. Some of them may require a fair amount of research. If you'd like to work on one, put your name by it. 

  * [[wordpress:advanced-topics:custom-content|Custom Content]]: This is a tutorial on WordPress custom content types and custom fields. We need a general overview of what they are, what they're for, and what plugins people can use to create/manage them. 

  * [[wordpress:advanced-topics:using-feedwordpress|Feedwordpress]]: This is a tutorial on installing FeedWordPress and configuring it (as well as a general introduction to the concept of syndication) **JACK**

  * [[wordpress:advanced-topics:advanced-wordpress-themes|Advanced WordPress Theme Techniques]]: This is a tutorial on advanced techniques for working with WordPress themes. When you install a new theme, how do you go about figuring out how to use it? What are some good tips/best practices?

  * [[domain-of-ones-own:domain-management:domain-verification|Domain Verification]]: This is a tutorial on the domain verification process which now requires all users to verify that they are the owner of a domain within 2 weeks of it being registered. If they don't do this, the domain is suspended and their site becomes unavailable (until they do the verification). The BIG sticking point with this is that the verification emails invariably go into students' Junk Mail folder and they never remember to look there In order to do this tutorial, someone will probably need to register a domain (to get a screenshot of the email). It's also good to include information about the verification notice that appears in cPanel if you haven't verified your domain (see [[dkc-private:resending-verification|Resend Verification Email]] for more information) and as screenshot of what an unverified (suspended) domain looks like. You'll need to work with me or someone in DTLT to complete this tutorial. 

  * [[wordpress:appearance-plugins:installing-themes | Installing Themes]]: we need a document that focuses on the process of finding and installing new themes in WordPress. Feel free to borrow from the existing [[wordpress:appearance-plugins:themes | WordPress Themes]] document.

  * [[wordpress:appearance-plugins:changing-the-theme | Changing the Theme]]: this tutorial needs to be fleshed out to include info on finding existing themes, including using the theme filter interface, and activating them. It should also give some specifics about where to look for additional theme options and customizations. This tutorial should be generic enough to be useful for both UMW Blogs and UMW Domains users. Feel free to borrow from the existing [[wordpress:appearance-plugins:themes | WordPress Themes]] document.



==== Completed ====

  * [[other-software-tools:storymap:storymap | StoryMap Tutorial]]: We need a basic tutorial to using creating a StoryMap using the SM authoring tool. It should include an introduction to the basic concepts/interface, step-by-steps for common tasks, and screenshots, as necessary.**JESS-done**
