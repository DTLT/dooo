  * With public_html selected, click New Folder from the top-menu. Now, in the New Folder dialog box, input your New Folder Name and click Create New Folder.
  * Now you have a new folder with which you can upload files to your web space.
  * You can view an index of your folder by visiting http://yourdomain.com/foldername/. The index will include a list of links to the files in your folder. If you wish to view the individual file, include the name of the file after the folder’s name in the URL; for example, http://yourdomain.com/foldername/file.html/.
