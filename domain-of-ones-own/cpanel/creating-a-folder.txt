====== Creating a Folder ======

  * Creating a folder in your Domain of One’s Own web space is fairly simple. First, login to your Domain of One’s Own account and locate your dashboard.
  * On the dashboard scroll-down to files and click on **File Manager**. This will bring up the **File Manager Directory Selection**. With the **Web Root (public_html/www)** selected, click **Go**.

  * With public_html selected, click **New Folder** from the top-menu. Now, in the New Folder dialog box, input your **New Folder Name** and click **Create New Folder**.

  * Now you have a new folder with which you can upload files to your web space.
  * You can view an index of your folder by visiting **http://yourdomain.com/foldername/**. The index will include a list of links to the files in your folder. If you wish to view the individual file, include the name of the file after the folder’s name in the URL; for example, **http://yourdomain.com/foldername/file.html/**.
