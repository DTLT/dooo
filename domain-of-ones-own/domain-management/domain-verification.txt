====== Domain Verification ======

Having recently created a domain with Domain of Ones Own, students are required to verify their domain with ICANN. This is a very simple process that consists of clicking a few buttons, and in some cases resending verification emails. If a student comes in looking to get their domain verified, go through these steps to get their websites back up and running. 

====== Step 1: Check Their Spam Folder ======

The issue with these emails is that UMW's email filters tend to throw these verification emails into students spam folders. Have the student navigate to their email, and if the email is not present in their inbox, then have them navigate to their spam folder. In their spam folder, there should be an email that has a subject line similar to this:

{{https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5614/15596925999_7ac25da85d_o.png}}

where the black box at the end of the subject line is replaced by the students domain name. If the email is not present anywhere, skip to Step 2. Otherwise, click on this email and open it. The email should look something like this:

follow the prompt by clicking on the link asking to verify the students email. Following that, a webpage will open up notifying the user that their email has been verified. **Note:** The students webpage might not be available to them for another 24 hours, as it takes time to propagate through the web and various servers. **Congratulations! You just verified a domain!**

====== Step 2: Go to the Site ======

If the student cannot find the verification email, have them navigate to the URL of the domain they are needing to verify. A page like this should be present:

enter the captcha in the prompt on the screen and hit the button the resend the verification email. The email may take a little bit to find its way to the students email. **Congratulations! You just resent the verification email! Now skip back up to Step 1 to complete the verification process.**
