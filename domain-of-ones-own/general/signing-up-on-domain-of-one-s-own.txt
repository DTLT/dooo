It can take 20-30 seconds for your order to complete. When it's done, a confirmation page will appear. 

After you complete your order, you will receive an email with the subject "New Account Information." This contains important information about your actual hosting account/password and your new domain. We recommend saving this somewhere where you'll be able to find it again. 

That's it. You're now the proud owner of your own domain and Web hosting space!
