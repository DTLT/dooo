====== Managing Your Space ======

So there comes a time in every Domains life where it grows too big and you must asses the situation. This is typically forced by the notification or email that informs you that your have run out of memory space. So lets start this process of figuring out what the root problem is.

Typically this problem is from one of three issues:
  - Unnecessary Backup files still on the drive.
  - Too many photos or videos, this is ex only exacerbated if they are of high quality.
  - You have so much content! This is awesome and you should not feel bad!

To being assessing which of the three is really this issue you should first log into your cPanel.

Go to [[http://umw.domains|UMW Domains]]

Click on the left hand side where it says "Login / Signup" Please note that if you are a student, your email address must include full complete "mail.umw.edu" suffix.

Disk Usage Viewer provides an overview of the disk space for that account. It shows disk usage totals for your accountâ€™s directories and all of its databases rather than for individual files or databases. For future reference you can use the [[domain-of-ones-own:cpanel:accessing-your-files-through-the-file-manager|File Manager]] to see disk usage data for individual files.
