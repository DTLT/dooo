====== Managing Your Space ======

So there comes a time in every Domains life where it grows too big and you must asses the situation. This is typically forced by the notification or email that informs you that your have run out of memory space. So lets start this process of figuring out what the root problem is.

Typically this problem is from one of three issues:
  - Unnecessary Backup files still on the drive.
  - Too many photos or videos, this is ex only exacerbated if they are of high quality.
  - You have so much content! This is awesome and you should not feel bad!

==== Assessing usage ====
To being assessing which of the three is really this issue you should first log into your cPanel.

Go to [[http://umw.domains|UMW Domains]]

Click on the left hand side where it says "Login / Signup" Please note that if you are a student, your email address must include full complete "mail.umw.edu" suffix.

You will be redirected to a UMW Page to login for verification. You will use your UMW NetID/password to login. Afterwards, you will be arrive at your cPanel.

Scroll down to "**Files**."

Click on "**Disk Space Usage**."

Disk Usage Viewer provides an overview of the disk space for that account. It shows disk usage totals for your accountâ€™s directories and all of its databases rather than for individual files or databases. For future reference you can use the [[domain-of-ones-own:cpanel:accessing-your-files-through-the-file-manager|File Manager]] to see disk usage data for individual files. 


Here you can now see how your space is being used.

So now we can see that, in this case, the back ups are responsible for using most of the space.

==== Managing Backups ====

Once logged into the appropriate user account for Domain of One's Own you can now check backups for all applications using Installatron.

1. Scroll down to "**Web Applications**."

2. Click on the desired application.

3. Click on "**My Backups**."

4. You can now see all the backups for that user's account.

From here you can delete older backups. It is recommended to not delete all of them, but just ones that are older than a more current one. This is because if there is any issue you can reload this version of your website, but it really is only necessary to have one. Sometimes it saves multiple copies of the backups and does not delete old ones.

==== Managing Pictures ====

Returning to the issue about having to many pictures or videos this can be seen in the same way from the disk usage viewer.

Here you'll see that this public_html/ is using a lot of memory. This means that there is a lot of pictures, videos, or content.

Now we cannot really do anything about this for you. What we highly recommend doing is to create an account on a image hosting site. This way you can have a lot more space to to hold the images and then just embed them into your posts. This was it doesn't actually use this memory space on the site.

We highly recommend [[https://www.flickr.com/|flikr]], but there are many other sites that may meet your needs such as [[http://imgur.com|imgur]].

==== Managing Content ====

If you have gone through all of the troubleshooting steps above and you still have issues with the space on the website, then you most likely have too much content! This means have been a very busy blogger and you have so much text and content that we really have no other option. Please make an appointment to see a Digital Knowledge Center Tutor or someone from the DTLT to assist you.
