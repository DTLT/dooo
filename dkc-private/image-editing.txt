====== Image Editing ======
There are several different types of image editing software that range from easy to advanced and free to expensive. To get the most out of your image editing you would want to use Photoshop because it has the most advanced tools to edit the image you want to change or create. However, most of us do not have access or can afford the cost of Photoshop, which is why some amazing person came along and created the open source software known as GIMP.

As stated above GIMP is essentially the free version of Photoshop. Many of the same tools featured in PS are found in GIMP. However, you may not get the same level of image manipulation as you would with PS.
