    - They may be over their quota because they are in a class such as DS106, which has them uploading a lot of content. If they are over their quota because they are uploading pictures with unnecessarily large file sizes, suggest they either resize their photos before uploading, or use an image sharing site such as Imgur or Flickr and embed the pictures into the post from the site.
