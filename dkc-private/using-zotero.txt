=== Adding Stuff to Your Library ===
  * **Adding items** to your Zotero library is very simple. All you have to do is click the icon that appears in far right side of the URL address bar. The icons differ based on what kind of material it is you are saving to your library. Once you click the icon, that item is automatically saved to your Zotero library on the browser.
