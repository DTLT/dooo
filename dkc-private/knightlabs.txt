====== TimelineJS or StoryMapJS ======

TimelineJS is an open source tool for creating interactive timelines. You use a Google spreadsheet to manage the data for the timeline. Knight Lab (the organization that built/provides the TimelineJS script) provides a template for the spreadsheet, but we recommend using a custom template that DTLT has built. 

**Preparing for this tutorial:**

  - Review [[http://support.umwblogs.org/other-tools/spreadsheet-timeline/using-the-umw-spreadsheet-timeline | the tutorial for using TimelineJS]].
  - Review the [[http://timeline.knightlab.com/#make|FAQ at the TimelineJS Web site]].
  - Build your own own timeline (it can be of events surrounding a period of history or events from your own life) and blog it (tag: dkctutortimeline).
