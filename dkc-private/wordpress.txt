====== WordPress Tutorial Training ======

DKC tutorials on WordPress cover both the use of UMW Blogs (which runs a particular variety WordPress known as WordPress Multisite) and individual installs of WordPress that a student might have on their Domain of One Own's Account. It's important for tutors to understand the difference between working with WordPress in UMW Blogs vs. in Domain of One's Own. 

===== UMW Blogs WordPress =====

When using WordPress on UMW Blogs, students have access to individual WordPress sites that are provisioned through WordPress Multisite (WPMS). DTLT maintains the core WPMS files that are used by every provisioned site in the system, including the available plugins and themes. 

From a permissions standpoint, there are two kinds of administrators in UMW Blogs. Every site can have users with **(site) administrator** permissions. These users can manage all of the site's settings, activate plugins & themes, add new users, etc. In addition, at a system level, there is a **super administrator** account. This account can add plugins/themes and change system-wide settings. 

While site administrators can activate the plugins and themes that are available to them through the system, only super administrators can add new plugins and themes to the system as a whole.

Only UMW community members can obtain an account in UMW Blogs. This is managed by requiring them to use a "umw.edu" or "mail.umw.edu" email address to register an account. Once a user has an account in the system, they can create as many sites as they want, and they can be added to any existing site (by either that site's administrator or the super administrator). 

In addition, it's possible for someone to create a user account on UMW Blogs but NOT create an associated site. Having just a user account allows them to be added to a site that someone else has created or administers. We have several courses at UMW that use this approach to create a group blog/site; students in the class create a user account on UMW Blogs (but no actual blog), and are then added to the course site by either the instructor or a staff member in DTLT. 

We do not actively delete users or sites on UMW Blogs. Occasionally, we will remove sites that were created but have never been updated or changed (for many months or even years). Beyond that, the only times we remove sites/users is if a user asks us to. 

Another important nuance to running WordPress Multisite is that the super administrator becomes responsible for all updates to the system: WordPress updates, plugin updates, and theme updates. Since every site makes use of the same base code installation, those updates only need to occur in one place in order to impact every site in the system. In DTLT, we try to reserve major updates for semester/winter/summer holidays. Some updates can cause sites to break, and we try to limit this disruption during the semester.

===== Domain of One's Own WordPress =====

On Domain of One's Own, it is possible for any user to install WordPress on their domain using the Installatron script installer. When a user runs WordPress on Domain of One's Own, he/she becomes the overall administrator for the entire site. Users can add any plugins/themes they want to their DoOO WordPress install, and they can add any users to the site they create. They are also responsible for ensuring that the site is regularly updated, including all plugins and themes.

Beyond the administrative differences, using WordPress on UMW Blogs and DoOO is really identical -- the core WordPress code used is the same, so the steps to add content, change settings, etc. are the same.

Review all of the [[http://docs.umwdomains.com/wordpress/wordpress|WordPress documentation]] at the [[http://docs.umwdomains.com|UMW Domains Support site]]. There will be overlap between this documentation and the UMW Blogs documentation, but please review it all as there are some differences (how to install plugins/themes, for example). Eventually, we will be consolidating all of this WordPress documentation in one place, and if you are familiar with both sets, you'll be better able to assist in this project.
