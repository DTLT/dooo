====== WordPress Tutorial Training ======

DKC tutorials on WordPress cover both the use of UMW Blogs (which runs a particular variety WordPress known as WordPress Multisite) and individual installs of WordPress that a student might have on their Domain of One Own's Account. It's important for tutors to understand the difference between working with WordPress in UMW Blogs vs. in Domain of One's Own. 

===== UMW Blogs WordPress =====

When using WordPress on UMW Blogs, students have access to individual WordPress sites that are provisioned through WordPress Multisite (WPMS). DTLT maintains the core WPMS files that are used by every provisioned site in the system, including the available plugins and themes. 

From a permissions standpoint, there are two kinds of administrators in UMW Blogs. Every site can have users with **(site) administrator** permissions. These users can manage all of the site's settings, activate plugins & themes, add new users, etc. In addition, at a system level, there is a **super administrator** account. This account can add plugins/themes and change system-wide settings. 

While site administrators can activate the plugins and themes that are available to them through the system, only super administrators can add new plugins and themes to the system as a whole.

Only UMW community members can obtain an account in UMW Blogs. This is managed by requiring them to use a "umw.edu" or "mail.umw.edu" email address to register an account. Once a user has an account in the system, they can create as many sites as they want, and they can be added to any existing site (by either that site's administrator or the super administrator). 

In addition, it's possible for someone to create a user account on UMW Blogs but NOT create an associated site. Having just a user account allows them to be added to a site that someone else has created or administers. We have several courses at UMW that use this approach to create a group blog/site; students in the class create a user account on UMW Blogs (but no actual blog), and are then added to the course site by either the instructor or a staff member in DTLT. 

We do not actively delete users or sites on UMW Blogs. Occasionally, we will remove sites that were created but have never been updated or changed (for many months or even years). Beyond that, the only times we remove sites/users is if a user asks us to. 

Another important nuance to running WordPress Multisite is that the super administrator becomes responsible for all updates to the system: WordPress updates, plugin updates, and theme updates. Since every site makes use of the same base code installation, those updates only need to occur in one place in order to impact every site in the system. In DTLT, we try to reserve major updates for semester/winter/summer holidays. Some updates can cause sites to break, and we try to limit this disruption during the semester.

===== Domain of One's Own WordPress =====

On Domain of One's Own, it is possible for any user to install WordPress on their domain using the Installatron script installer. When a user runs WordPress on Domain of One's Own, he/she becomes the overall administrator for the entire site. Users can add any plugins/themes they want to their DoOO WordPress install, and they can add any users to the site they create. They are also responsible for ensuring that the site is regularly updated, including all plugins and themes.

Beyond the administrative differences, using WordPress on UMW Blogs and DoOO is really identical -- the core WordPress code used is the same, so the steps to add content, change settings, etc. are the same.

Review all of the [[http://docs.umwdomains.com/wordpress/wordpress|WordPress documentation]] at the [[http://docs.umwdomains.com|UMW Domains Support site]]. There will be overlap between this documentation and the UMW Blogs documentation, but please review it all as there are some differences (how to install plugins/themes, for example). Eventually, we will be consolidating all of this WordPress documentation in one place, and if you are familiar with both sets, you'll be better able to assist in this project. 

===== WordPress Course Web Sites =====

Many faculty at UMW make use of WordPress to run course Web sites. Students frequently need help getting themselves "connected" to these sites. How they connect depends on how the course site is designed, and the design is determined by the needs/wishes of the faculty member. There are generally three models of course sites you may need to help students with: 

==== Group Blogs ====

In this case, there is a single WordPress site for a course where every student has an account. They each author posts locally on that site. 

Typically in this case, students have been told to add themselves to a course site by using the "Add User" widget which should appear in the site's sidebar. If a student is at the DKC for a tutorial, you can also have them add themselves using the technique. [[http://support.umwblogs.org/getting-started/adding-yourself-to-a-course-blog | Tutorial on Adding Yourself to a Course Site]]

If you are assisting a student from afar (they've put a Question on the DKC site or emailed the Center), you can log into the course site on UMW Blogs and add them by going to Users->Add Users. As a super administrator, you can add them without sending a confirmation email, too. 

If the student is supposed to be added to a faculty member's course site on Domain of One's Own, you should recommend they contact the faculty member to do this or ask a DTLT staff member for assistance. (For now, DKC tutors should refrain from logging into faculty Web sites on Domain of One's Own.)

==== Syndication ====

When a course isn't using a group course site, they are going to be making use of some kind of syndication. In a syndication model, the students have their own sites where they author their own posts. As they write those posts, they are syndicated to a course site where they are republished (but still link back to the original student's site).

There are two primary kinds of syndication we use: link syndication and tag syndication. Both methods make use of a plugin called FeedWordPress. Please spend sometime familiarizing yourself with FeedWordpress:

  * [[https://wordpress.org/plugins/feedwordpress/|FeedWordPress plugin page in the Plugin Repository]]

=== Tag Syndication ===
 
On UMW Blogs, we typically use a model of syndication that relies on using tags. On their own site, the students make sure they are using a designated tag for all the posts that should be syndicated to the course site. Then, on the course site, we regularly check for new posts around UMW Blogs using this tag and pull them in. 

Students must enter the tag **exactly** as it was told to them, paying attention to spaces, uppercase/lowercase letters, etc. In addition, for this kind of syndication to work, students cannot have their blog set to private (see [[http://support.umwblogs.org/general-administration/setting-privacy-options | this tutorial on setting privacy options]])

In addition, students need to know that it can take up to a few hours for their post to show up on the course site, and if they are in a large class and everyone is submitting an assignment around the same time, their post may not show up on the front page of the course site (they may have to scroll a few pages  back to find it).

**This model of syndication is only used on UMW Blogs (not on Domain of One's Own). ** 

=== Link Syndication ===

The other model of syndication we use is to individually syndicate each students' blog to the course site using FeedWordPress. This is a more complicated model, and if a student runs into problems with it, you may need to login to the course site to look at the FeedWordPress settings.

===== Common Issues =====
   * Frequently students struggle with understanding the difference between pages and posts, particularly when it comes to syndication. It's important to understand that pages are NOT syndicated, so any syndicated course content needs to be in a post. 
   * When a student's post doesn't syndicate to the course site, the most common reasons are: 
     * not using the proper tag
     * setting their blog to be private
     * not waiting long enough for syndication to happen
     * not looking far enough back in the post archives (particularly when there are a lot of students in a class)
   * On UMW Blogs, students will sometimes create two different accounts, one using "umw.edu" for their email and the other using "mail.umw.edu" You may need to find their user accounts to determine which one they should be using for which site.
