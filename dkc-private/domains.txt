Generally, most students in Domain of One's Own use WordPress, so being familiar with all of the [[dkc-private:wordpress|WordPress Tutorial Training]]materias is also important. 

There are a few WordPress tutorials that are specific to DoOO (and not relevant to UMW Blogs):

  * [[wordpress:installing-wordpress|Installing Wordpress]]
  * [[wordpress:managing-comment-spam-with-akismet|Managing Comment Spam with Akismet]]
  * [[wordpress:wordpress-plugins|WordPress Plugins]]
  * [[wordpress:wordpress-themes|WordPress Themes]]

====== Common DoOO Issues ======

  * Students frequently are unsure about their accounts and what they are for. They may install WordPress and not know how to login. Or they may login to http://umwdomains.com instead of their WordPress site. Help them get to where they need to go, but also take the time explain to them what the different spaces/accounts are for. 
  * Domain verification continues to be the most common issue that students have (particularly early in the semester). The biggest issue is that a lot of the time the email goes to their Junk folder. 
  * Students can run out of space (we give them 500MB by default). We can increase quotas, but you should take the following steps BEFORE you just increase quotas:
    * Make sure they don't have application installations that they're not using. (Have them uninstall these)
    * Make sure they don't have a ton of backups in Installatron (They should generally only need one backup per application)
    * In their WordPress installs, check their uploads folder and take a look at how big their files are. Some students upload the full-size photo they've taken with a DSLR. Recommend that they always resize images (no larger than 1000px width) before uploading. 
    * Recommend that they host their images elsewhere (Imgur or Flickr are both good recommendations) and link to them instead of uploading (you may need to show them how to do this). Tell them to only upload images that MUST be hosted in WordPress (an example would be images that they are using as Featured Images for a post; these can't be hosted elsewhere).
    * Finally, increase their quote by 250MB, explaining that they'll need to use these other techniques to avoid running out of space again (and that we can't promise we'll be able to give them additional increases)
