====== Saving Images ======

  * In GIMP, there is a difference between saving and exporting an image. 
  * To save an image, choose **File** > **Save** from the menubar, or press **Ctrl** + **S** on the keyboard.
  * In GIMP, saving an image means saving your project as a whole in a way that you can open it again in GIMP, with all of the layers, paths, etc. intact. 
  * By default, the Save Image dialog box will set the extension to **XCF**. This is GIMP's native format, and what you’ll want to save your project as if you wish to preserve your work and open it in the program again.

  * After you’ve chosen your desired location and named your file, click **Save**.

====== Exporting Images ======
 
  * To export your image, that is to save it as something other than GIMP’s native format (**PNG**, **GIF**, **JPG**, etc.), choose to **File** > **Export** from the menubar, or press **Ctrl** + **E** on the keyboard.
  * There are several extensions available in the Export dialog box. You can see a whole list of what’s available by clicking on Select File Type (By Extension) at the bottom of the dialog box. However, most projects you do will use **JPG**, **PNG**, or **GIF**.

  * After you’ve chosen your desired location and named your file, click **Export**.
  * Depending on the extension you chose, a second dialog box may pop up. In most cases, you should simply click **Export** again. The second dialog box allows you to alter aspects of the file extension, including quality and file size. In most cases, the defaults should be fine.

  * To save a copy of an image using a different file name or extension, simple choose **Save as…** or **Export as…** from the File menu and follow the same instructions.
