====== Pixlr ======
Pixlr is at [[http://www.pixlr.com/]] and as you can see, the home page allows you to make an account, or continue to the editors without an account. There are 3 web applications that you can use on Pixlr. There’s **Pixlr Editor**, **Pixlr Express** and **Pixlr O-Matic**.

===== Pixlr Editor =====

=== About ===
 
By far the most useful of the three editors, you can create your own image, upload an image to edit, import an image from a url, and if you have an account you can import an image from your library.


Selecting "Create a new image," brings you into an editor that is similar to photoshop.

  * All of the //tools// are on the //left//, the __navigator, layers, and history__ are on the __right__, and then **other effects or editing functions** are on the top in the **menu bar**.

  * All of the essential tools are there for you to use, such as the lasso tool, select tool, cropping tool, clone stamp, magic wand, burn and dodge tools, paintbrush, fill can, dropper, and text tool.

  * Another feature that is similar to Photoshop is that **you can open multiple images at once**. The only difference is that all of your images will appear in this grey area in separate windows, instead of in different tabs. 

  * When you are ready to save, **you can save it to your Google Drive** //or// to your computer **as JPEG** (you can choose the quality), **PNG** (great for transparent images), **BMP**, **TIFF**, and **PXD** (layered Pixlr image for if you want to go back later and continue editing).

===== Pixlr Express =====

=== About ===

Pixlr Express is great for editing images quickly and without the hassle of using the Photoshop-like interface. Although you cannot do as much as you can in the Pixlr Editor.

Pixlr Express allows you to upload your images from your computer or a URL and allows you to edit a picture taken from your Webcam.

I uploaded a picture of the UMW Bell Tower as an example.

  * At the //bottom// are all your //tools which includes adjustment functions, effects, overlays, borders, stickers, and text//. At the __top__ there is the __zoom function, and the undo and redo functions__.

  * Even though Pixlr Express does not have as many tools for adjusting the image as Pixlr Editor, they still give you a fair amount of adjustment tools like blurring, adding an additional image, rotating, resizing, cropping, contrast editing, etc.

  * The effect tools are also pretty helpful as well. At first they may just seem like instrgram filters, but there is quite a few of different effects that you can implement on your image that change the color and/or brightness. Within the main categories of the effects you see below, there are numerous options, so there is definitely a wide range of effects to pick from!

  * The biggest downside to Pixlr Express is that **you can only save your image in JPEG form**, but you can still set the save quality to 100% in order to maintain the best quality of image as possible.

===== Pixlr O-Matic =====

=== About ===
The least complex image editor out of the three different Pixlr web applications.

You can still upload images from your computer or webcam but you cannot import images from a URL. Pixlr O-Matic has the similar features to Pixlr Express but has much less of them.

{{https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3954/15573539270_1ec49ccece_z.jpg}}

  * You can add some overlays, effects, borders, and filters. 

  * You cannot resize 

  * You can only crop with an aspect ratio of 1:1. 

  * You cannot chose how you save it or what quality it is when you save it.

That’s Pixlr! Happy image editing! :)
