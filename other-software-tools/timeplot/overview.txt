====== Overview ======


Timeplot is a Javascript application that allows users to take data files (in Text and XML formats) and create a timeline visualization of that data. It also allows users to overlay events with clickable information bubbles to explain certain events that may have impacted trends in the data. It contains options to improve the display, readability, and organization of the data.

In order to create a fully functional Timeplot, you must place three files on your Web server. If you want to use Timeplot on Domain of One's Own, we have created an installer in Installatron that will automatically unpack those files into a location you choose. The three files are: 
  * **An HTML file** (.html),
  * **a Text file** (.txt), and 
  * **an XML file** (.xml). 

The **HTML file** links to an external Javascript and contains additional Javascript code that controls the programs functionality and appearance. It also contains the HTML markup to actually display the Timeplot. [[timeplot:explanation-of-the-javascript-code-file|You can read more about the structure of the HTML file here.]] 

The **Text file** is the file that holds your raw data. This data will be read by the Javascript code to create the data points on your Timeplot. When plotted correctly, the x-axis of the Timeplot will display dates, and the y-axis will display the data values. Below is an example snippet of what the Text file looks like.

The **XML file** contains information about events that you want to plot against your numerical data. It is also read in by the Javascript code in the HTML file. Like the Text file, it is specially structured so that the Javascript can read it. Below is an example snippet of what the XML file looks like.
