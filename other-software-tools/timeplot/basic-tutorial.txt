====== Basic Tutorial ======

Before starting this tutorial, make sure you have [[other-software-tools:timeplot:installation|installed Timeplot]]. 

This tutorial will walk you through modifying the files that are created when you install Timeplot so that you can plot your own data. By the end, you will have a single data set plotted on a timeline, with visible axis markers, and rollover data information. For additional features, including adding more data sets to your timeline and adding events, [[other-software-tools:timeplot:advanced-tutorial|please review the Advanced Tutorial]]. 

**NOTE**

For the purpose of keeping this tutorial simple, we recommend that you edit the Timeplot files in the File Manager that is part of your Domain of One's Own dashboard. This tool works right in your Web browser and allows you to edit files on the Web server directly, so you do not need to edit files locally on your computer and then upload them to the server. One thing to keep in mind is that if you close a file in the File Manager editor, you will lose the ability to "Undo" any changes you've made. You may wish to periodically copy the working code from the editor into a Text editor program on your computer, so that you can easily revert to previous versions if suddenly your Timeplot stops working. 

=====Opening Your Files=====

First log into your Domain of One's Own account at [[http://www.umwdomains.com|umwdomains.com]].

{{:timeplot:umwdomains_homepage.png?300|}} {{:timeplot:umwdomains_login_page.png?275|}}

In the Dashboard, scroll down and click on the File Manager. Then select **Web Root** from the pop up window and click **Go**. You may want to review  [[domain-of-ones-own:cpanel:accessing-your-files-through-the-file-manager|the tutorial on the File Manager here]].

{{:timeplot:screen_shot_2014-07-02_at_4.37.05_pm.png?300|}}{{:timeplot:filemanager_pop_up.png?280|}}


Once inside find the file folder for your Timeplot; it should look like the image below (although the name of the folder will correspond to whatever sudomain/directory you chose for your install of Timeplot). Double-click and open the folder.

{{:timeplot:inside_file_manager.png?|}}

Inside you should see three files: 

  * index.html ([[other-software-tools:timeplot:explanation-of-the-javascript-code-file|Details about the HTML file can be found here.]])
  * data.txt ([[other-software-tools:timeplot:explanation-of-the-text-file|Details about the Text file can be found here.]])
  * events.xml ([[other-software-tools:timeplot:explanation-of-the-xml-file|Details about the XML file can be found here.]])

{{:timeplot:timeplot_file.png?|}}

To make changes to any file, click on it and select **Code Editor** from the toolbar at the top of the page.

{{  :timeplot:code_editor.png?  |}}

A pop up window will appear. Leave the settings as they are and click **Edit** in the bottom left corner.

=====Editing your Data (Text) File======

For the most part, the files that were created when you installed Timeplot, are configured to create the basic features of your Timeplot with little intervention. You will, however, have to replace the sample data with your own. 

To start, open the data.txt file following the instructions above about **Opening Your Files**. 

Next, if you haven't already, review the [[other-software-tools:timeplot:explanation-of-the-text-file|Explanation of the Text File]]. 

It should be clear how to edit/replace the sample data with your own. If you have already collected/formatted your data in a Text file on your computer (and/or shared it in Google Drive for your class), you can delete the contents of the sample file and simply copy/paste your data in its place. 

At the top of the file, you will see a comment block (denoted by the "#" tags) that you can replace with information about your own data. 

Below that, you will see the actual numerical data. Replace it with your own data. Make sure to use commas between dates and data and only put one date per line.

The sample data for Timeplot includes two sets of data. The plot will display two lines, one for each of these sets. You should plan on replacing the data with your own two sets of data in the text file. Later, if you wish, you can add additional data sets, being sure to use commas to separate the values for each date/row. You will need to [[other-software-tools:timeplot:advanced-tutorial|proceed to the Advanced Tutorial]] for information about how to plot those additional sets. 

When you are done exit out of the File Manager. Browse to the location of your TimePlot and you should now see your data plotted on the timeline. 

===== Editing the Event File =====

Just like you opened the data.txt file, you can also open and edit the events.xml file. If you haven't already, we recommend you review the [[other-software-tools:timeplot:explanation-of-the-xml-file|explanation of the XML File]]. 

In this file, we've placed three sample events. The first is a basic event with a start date. The second is an event with a start and end date. The third has a start and end date as well as a description. You can use this format to add your own events to the Timeplot. 

{{https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3911/15137318411_ff2ec032da_z.jpg}}

If you're not ready to add events, you can simply remove the <event /> code from the events.xml file. You can come back later to add your own events. 

===== Editing the HTML file and Adjusting the Graph =====
The final file you may edit is the index.html file which contains the script and code to actually build your Timeplot. You may open and edit it just as you opened the Text and XML files. 

For the purposes of this basic tutorial, there are a few variables that you can change in order to alter the appearance of your graph: 

====Grid Colors====

You may change the color of the grid associated with both the data and the events. You must replace the existing values with another hexadecimal color code. [[http://html-color-codes.info/|You can read more about hex color codes here.]]

====Axis Label Placement====
By default, the x- and y-axis labels are placed at the left and bottom of the graph. You may change these to "top" or "right," if you like.

==== Data Range ====
Depending on the lowest/highest values in your data set(s), you may wish to adjust the data range for your Timeplot.
