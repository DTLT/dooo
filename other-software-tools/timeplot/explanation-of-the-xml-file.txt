===== Explanation of the XML File =====

The XML file (which uses the .xml extension) contains information about events that you want to plot against your numerical data. It is also read in by the Javascript code in the main HTML file. It is specially structured so that the javascript can read it. 

In order to successfully create a Timeplot you must use a specific format for the XML file. You may either create your XML file from scratch (using the format described below) or edit the sample XML file that is created when you install Timeplot using Installatron.

=====To Create an XML File from Scratch=====

An XML file is really just a special "flavor" of a text file, so you will need to use a text editing program on your computer to create your XML file. On Windows computers we recommend Notepad (free with the Windows operating system). On Macintosh computers we recommend Text Wrangler ([[http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/|Download for free here.]])

Remember when you save your file to use the .xml extension!

=====To Edit the Sample XML File=====

First log into your Domain of One's Own account at [[http://www.umwdomains.com|umwdomains.com]].

{{:timeplot:umwdomains_homepage.png?300|}} {{:timeplot:umwdomains_login_page.png?275|}}

In the Dashboard, scroll down and click on the File Manager. Then select **Web Root** from the pop up window and click **Go**. You may want to review  [[domain-of-ones-own:cpanel:accessing-your-files-through-the-file-manager|the tutorial on the File Manager here]].

{{:timeplot:screen_shot_2014-07-02_at_4.37.05_pm.png?300|}}{{:timeplot:filemanager_pop_up.png?280|}}

Once inside find the file folder for your Timeplot; it should look like the image below (although the name of the folder will correspond to whatever sudomain/directory you chose for your install of Timeplot). Double-click and open the folder.

{{:timeplot:inside_file_manager.png?|}}

Inside you should see events.xml. This is the sample XML file that we recommend you edit. 

To make changes to the file, click on it and select **Code Editor** from the toolbar at the top of the page.

{{  :timeplot:code_editor.png?  |}}

A pop up window will appear. Leave the settings as they are and click **Edit** in the bottom left corner.

=====Basic Format of the XML File=====

Whether you're creating an XML file from scratch or modifying a sample file, the ultimate format will be the same. The format of the file consists, generally, of each event on a single line, with information properly formatted so that it can be read by the Timeplot Javascript. 

The image below shows a snippet of the default event XML file that will be created if you you install Timeplot using Installatron on Domain of One's Own. (It shows events that correspond with the President George W. Bush approval ratings data that is contained in the default text file  created when you use Installatron to install Timeplot.)

You can see that each event is contained within an tag titled "event," and they contain three individual values: 
  * start: The date (and time, if appropriate) of the event. 
  * title: The title of the event (this will appear in a pop-up bubble on the Timeplot)
  * link: An (optional) URL that users can click on for more information about the event. 

Please note that all values must be contained in quotation marks. In addition, you must include the closing forward slash before you close the event tag: 

<code xml>
<event start="YOUR DATE GOES HERE" title="YOUR TITLE GOES HERE" link="YOUR URL GOES HERE" />
</code>

You may add as many events as you like, using this standard format. 

=====Additional Event Data=====

There are a few additional values you can add to your events beyond what's contained in the sample file (and example above).

====End Dates====
If you wish to create an event that has a distinct start and end date (which will appear as a band on the Timeplot instead of just a line), you can add an end date. Simply include an "end" variable in the event tag: 

<code xml>
<event start="YOUR START DATE GOES HERE" end="YOUR END DATE GOES HERE" title="YOUR TITLE GOES HERE" link="YOUR URL GOES HERE" />
</code>

====Descriptions====
Instead of including a URL, you may wish to put an actual description of your event, which will be included in the bubble that appears when someone clicks on the event in your Timeplot. You can do this by creating an explicit "open" and "close" event tag, with the description in between: 

<code xml>
<event start="YOUR DATE GOES HERE" title="YOUR TITLE GOES HERE" link="YOUR URL GOES HERE">
YOUR DESCRIPTION GOES HERE
</event>
</code>

Note that when you use an explicit close tag, you do not need to include the forward slash at the end of the first event tag.

====Event Colors====
You may wish to color-code your events (to correspond, for example, for different color lines on your Timeplot). 
If so, you can add a "color" variable to the event tag. 

<code xml>
<event start="YOUR DATE GOES HERE" title="YOUR TITLE GOES HERE" color="YOUR COLOR CODE GOES HERE" link="YOUR URL GOES HERE" />
</code>

Please note that your color choice must be represented as a hexadecimal code.  [[http://html-color-codes.info/|You can read more about hex color codes here.]]

=====A Note about Date/Time Formatting=====

We recommend you use the following formats for date/time: 
  * Date Only: **Month DD YYYY** (ex.May 10 1961)
  * Date & Time: **Month DD YYYY HH:MM:SS GMTOffset** (ex. May 10 1961 00:00:00 GMT-0600)

=====Using the XML File=====
If you installed Timeplot using Installatron on Domain of One's Own, you'll have received a set of sample files that include event data corresponding to President Bush's approval ratings in .xml file. You may replace the event data with your own.

In the Basic Tutorial, we will walk you through how to modify the XML file so that your events appear in your Timeplot.
