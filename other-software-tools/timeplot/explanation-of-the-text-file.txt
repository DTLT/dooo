====== Explanation of the Text File ======

The text file (which uses a .txt extension) is the file that holds the raw data that the Javascript code reads into the program to create the data points on your Timeplot. When plotted correctly, the x-axis of the Timeplot will display dates and the y-axis will display the range of data values. 

In order to successfully create a Timeplot you must use a specific format for the text file. You may either create your text file from scratch (using the format described below) or edit the sample text file that is created when you install Timeplot using Installatron. 

=====To Create a Text File from Scratch=====

You will need to use a text editing program on your computer to create your text file. On Windows computers we recommend Notepad (free with the Windows operating system). On Macintosh computers we recommend Text Wrangler ([[http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/|Download for free here.]])

=====To Edit the Sample Text File=====

First log into your Domain of One's Own account at [[http://www.umwdomains.com|umwdomains.com]].

{{:timeplot:umwdomains_homepage.png?300|}} {{:timeplot:umwdomains_login_page.png?275|}}

In the Dashboard, scroll down and click on the File Manager. Then select **Web Root** from the pop up window and click **Go**. You may want to review  [[domain-of-ones-own:cpanel:accessing-your-files-through-the-file-manager|the tutorial on the File Manager here]].

{{:timeplot:screen_shot_2014-07-02_at_4.37.05_pm.png?300|}}{{:timeplot:filemanager_pop_up.png?280|}}

Once inside find the file folder for your Timeplot; it should look like the image below (although the name of the folder will correspond to whatever sudomain/directory you chose for your install of Timeplot). Double-click and open the folder.

Inside you should see data.txt. This is the sample Text file that we recommend you edit. 

To make changes to the file, click on it and select **Code Editor** from the toolbar at the top of the page.

A pop up window will appear. Leave the settings as they are and click **Edit** in the bottom left corner.

=====Format of the Text File=====

Whether you're creating a text file from scratch or modifying the sample file, the ultimate format will be the same. The format of the data file, generally, consists of a single date and its corresponding data values all on a single line. The date and all values should be separated by commas. 

The example image below shows a text file containing data about President George W. Bush' approval ratings. At the top of the file, you'll see a comment block (each comment line denoted by a "#"), indicating what the data is and where it came from. Right above the data is a comment that indicates what the numerical values below are: dates and approval ratings (in percentages).

You can imagine each line of the file as a row in a spreadsheet and the commas as delimiting the placement of columns:

Timeplot allows you to plot multiple sets of data against the same selection of dates. You can include all of this data in a single text file. Imagine that each time you add a comma, you are adding another column to your "spreadhseet." 

In the images below, you'll see we've added additional ratings for President Bush (corresponding to the same dates) to the text file. The first image shows the regular text file; in the second one, we've added lines to indicate where the "columns" are:

=====Using the Text File=====
If you installed Timeplot using Installatron on Domain of One's Own, you'll have received a set of sample files that include the President Bush approval ratings data in .txt file. The file contains all three ratings. You may replace this data with your own data. 

In the [[other-software-tools:timeplot:basic-tutorial|Basic Tutorial]], we will walk you through how to modify the text file so that your data appears in your Timeplot.
