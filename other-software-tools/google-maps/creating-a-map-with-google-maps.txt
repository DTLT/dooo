====== Creating a Map with Google Maps ======

===== Before You Begin =====
  * **Google+ Account** You will need to have a Google+ account before you begin because your work will be saved in Google Drive.
  * **Know Your Data** The workflow is much easier if you go into it knowing all the data you need to input into the map. Otherwise, a lot of time will be spent googling or wandering Google Maps in search of the correct location.
===== Making the Map =====
  - Go to [[https://www.google.com/maps | maps.google.com]]. Make sure you are logged in to your Google+ account. If not, you can do so by clicking the blue **sign in** button on the upper right-hand corner of the map. {{https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8622/16043583170_a5f4b00947_z.jpg}}
  - Once you are signed in, click the search bar on the upper left-hand corner and you will see **my maps** appear below it. {{https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7580/16230153372_9992c76d26_z.jpg}}
  - Select **create**. {{https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7555/16229098321_2e504ba825.jpg}} 
  - You will be brought to a new page, which is your workspace for creating the map. {{https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8574/16043456288_9fbf464d90_z.jpg}}
===== Map Basics =====
==== Naming the Map ====
The first thing you will want to do is give the map a name. This will also serve as the file name it will be saved under in Google Drive. 
To rename the map, click **untitled map**.

Type in your desired map name and description (if you would like), but only the map name is required. Then click **save**.

==== Layers ====
Layers work much like folders in that they are a way of grouping and viewing data on the map. Whatever layer is selected when a location point is created, that will be the layer that the location point is categorized under. 
To rename a layer, click on the three vertical dots to the right of **untitled layer**.

A drop-down box will appear and you will select **rename layer**.

A window will appear and you will rename the layer and then select **save**.

==== Adding Location Points ====
To add a location point onto the map, first **make sure you have the correct layer selected**. There should be a blue line on the left-hand side of the layer category to show that it is the current layer selected. **If you do not have the correct layer selected when you add a location point, you will NOT be able to move the location point to the correct layer. You will have to DELETE the location point and start over.**

Since you are starting out with a full view of the U.S., you will want to use the search bar to get you closer the point you want to mark.

To drop a pin, select the pin icon from below the search bar.
{{https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8669/16205063926_b08424b02e_z.jpg}}
Then click the location you would like to be marked to drop a pin. A red pin will appear along with a window. Give your location point a name and a description (if desired) and then select **save**.
{{https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8653/15611116473_911ffb7ed3.jpg}}
Now you will see the name of the location point under the layer it is categorized in.
