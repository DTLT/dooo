====== Creating a Map with Google Maps ======

===== Before You Begin =====
  * **Google+ Account** You will need to have a Google+ account before you begin because your work will be saved in Google Drive.
  * **Know Your Data** The workflow is much easier if you go into it knowing all the data you need to input into the map. Otherwise, a lot of time will be spent googling or wandering Google Maps in search of the correct location.
===== Making the Map =====
  - Go to [[https://www.google.com/maps | maps.google.com]]. Make sure you are logged in to your Google+ account. If not, you can do so by clicking the blue **sign in** button on the upper right-hand corner of the map. {{GM step 1}}
