====== Creating a Map with Google Maps ======

===== Before You Begin =====
  * **Google+ Account** You will need to have a Google+ account before you begin because your work will be saved in Google Drive.
  * **Know Your Data** The workflow is much easier if you go into it knowing all the data you need to input into the map. Otherwise, a lot of time will be spent googling or wandering Google Maps in search of the correct location.
===== Making the Map =====
  - Go to [[https://www.google.com/maps | maps.google.com]]. Make sure you are logged in to your Google+ account. If not, you can do so by clicking the blue **sign in** button on the upper right-hand corner of the map. {{GM step 1}}
  - Once you are signed in, click the search bar on the upper left-hand corner and you will see **my maps** appear below it. {{GM step 2}}
  - Select **create**. {{GM step 3}} 
  - You will be brought to a new page, which is your workspace for creating the map. {{GM step 4}}
===== Map Basics =====
==== Naming the Map ====
The first thing you will want to do is give the map a name. This will also serve as the file name it will be saved under in Google Drive. 
To rename the map, click **untitled map**. 
{{GM step 5}} 
Type in your desired map name and description if you would like, but only the map name is required. Then click **save**. 
{{GM step 6}}
==== Layers ====
Layers work much like folders in that they are a way of grouping and viewing data on the map. 
To rename a layer, click on the three vertical dots to the right of **untitled layer**. 
{{GM step 7}} 
A drop-down box will appear and you will select **rename layer**. 
{{GM step 8}} 
A window will appear and you will rename the layer and then select **save**. 
{{GM step 9}}
To add more layers, select **add layer**.
