====== Creating a Map with Google Maps ======

===== Before You Begin =====
  * **Google+ Account** You will need to have a Google+ account before you begin because your work will be saved in Google Drive.
  * **Know Your Data** The workflow is much easier if you go into it knowing all the data you need to input into the map. Otherwise, a lot of time will be spent googling or wandering Google Maps in search of the correct location.
===== Making the Map =====
  - Go to [[https://www.google.com/maps | maps.google.com]]. Make sure you are logged in to your Google+ account. If not, you can do so by clicking the blue **sign in** button on the upper right-hand corner of the map. {{https://www.flickr.com/photos/umwdtlt/16043583170/}}
  - Once you are signed in, click the search bar on the upper left-hand corner and you will see **my maps** appear below it. {{GM step 2}}
  - Select **create**. {{GM step 3}} 
  - You will be brought to a new page, which is your workspace for creating the map. {{GM step 4}}
===== Map Basics =====
==== Naming the Map ====
The first thing you will want to do is give the map a name. This will also serve as the file name it will be saved under in Google Drive. 
To rename the map, click **untitled map**. 
{{GM step 5}} 
Type in your desired map name and description if you would like, but only the map name is required. Then click **save**. 
{{GM step 6}}
==== Layers ====
Layers work much like folders in that they are a way of grouping and viewing data on the map. Whatever layer is selected when a location point is created, that will be the layer that the location point is categorized under. 
To rename a layer, click on the three vertical dots to the right of **untitled layer**. 
{{GM step 7}} 
A drop-down box will appear and you will select **rename layer**. 
{{GM step 8}} 
A window will appear and you will rename the layer and then select **save**. 
{{GM step 9}}
To add more layers, select **add layer**.
{{GM step 10}} 

==== Adding Location Points ====
To add a location point onto the map, first **make sure you have the correct layer selected**. There should be a blue line on the left-hand side of the layer category to show that it is the current layer selected. **If you do not have the correct layer selected when you add a location point, you will NOT be able to move the location point to the correct layer. You will have to DELETE the location point and start over.**
{{GM step 11}}
Since you are starting out with a full view of the U.S., you will want to use the search bar to get you closer the point you want to mark. 
{{GM step 12}}
To drop a pin, select the pin icon from below the search bar.
{{GM step 13}}
Then click the location you would like to be marked to drop a pin. A red pin will appear along with a window. Give your location point a name and a description (if desired) and then select **save**.
{{GM step 14}}
Now you will see the name of the location point under the layer it is categorized in.
