====== Creating a Map with Google Maps ======

===== Before You Begin =====
  * **Google+ Account:** You will need to have a Google+ account before you begin because your work will be saved in Google Drive.
  * **Know Your Data:** The workflow is much easier if you go into it knowing all the data you need to input into the map. Otherwise, a lot of time will be spent googling or wandering Google Maps in search of the correct location.
===== Making the Map =====
  - Go to [[https://www.google.com/maps | maps.google.com]]. Make sure you are logged in to your Google+ account. If not, you can do so by clicking the blue **sign in** button on the upper right-hand corner of the map.\\ {{https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8622/16043583170_a5f4b00947_z.jpg}}\\

  - Select **create**.\\ {{https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7555/16229098321_2e504ba825.jpg}}\\ 
  - You will be brought to a new page, which is your workspace for creating the map.\\ {{https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8574/16043456288_9fbf464d90_z.jpg}}\\
===== Map Basics =====
==== Naming the Map ====
The first thing you will want to do is give the map a name. This will also serve as the file name it will be saved under in Google Drive.\\ 
To rename the map, click **untitled map**.\\

Type in your desired map name and description (if you would like), but only the map name is required. Then click **save**.\\

==== Layers ====
Layers work much like folders in that they are a way of grouping and viewing data on the map. Whatever layer is selected when a location point is created, that will be the layer that the location point is categorized under.\\ 
To rename a layer, click on the three vertical dots to the right of **untitled layer**.\\ 
{{https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8657/16230965225_b284b5994b.jpg}}\\ 
A drop-down box will appear and you will select **rename layer**.\\ 
{{https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7550/16205063846_9d4f5a1233.jpg}}\\ 
A window will appear and you will rename the layer and then select **save**.\\ 
{{https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7503/16043583400_b9fd1ea7e8.jpg}}\\
To add more layers, select **add layer**.\\
{{https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8672/15608553294_dd95d31f2d.jpg}}\\ 

==== Adding Location Points ====
To add a location point onto the map, first **make sure you have the correct layer selected**. There should be a blue line on the left-hand side of the layer category to show that it is the current layer selected. **If you do not have the correct layer selected when you add a location point, you will NOT be able to move the location point to the correct layer. You will have to DELETE the location point and start over.**\\

Since you are starting out with a full view of the U.S., you will want to use the search bar to get you closer the point you want to mark.\\ 
{{https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7551/16044849479_6039f682ca.jpg}}\\
To drop a pin, select the pin icon from below the search bar.\\
{{https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8669/16205063926_b08424b02e_z.jpg}}\\
Then click the location you would like to be marked to drop a pin. A red pin will appear along with a window. Give your location point a name and a description (if desired) and then select **save**.\\
{{https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8653/15611116473_911ffb7ed3.jpg}}\\
Now you will see the name of the location point under the layer it is categorized in.\\

==== Adding Images and Video to Location Points ====
One way to provide more information about your location point on a map is to add images and video. You can have multiple images and video for each location point.\\ 
To edit the data (name, description, images, videos, etc.) of a location point, click on the pin on the map that marks the location point.\\
{{https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7501/16043821828_d8c3e9637d.jpg}}\\
A window will appear. Select the **pen icon** in the bottom right corner of the window.\\
{{https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8603/16231329565_b861808ccb.jpg}}\\
The window will switch so that you can edit the name and description. To add an image or video, select the **camera icon** in the bottom right corner of the window.\\
{{https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8605/15608920264_335dabf48c.jpg}}\\
A large window will appear. Across the top there will be four options: **Google Image Search**, **Image URL**, **Video search**, and **YouTube URL**. There will be a blue line under the option that is currently selected for use.\\

=== Adding an Image Using Google Image Search ===
Google Image Search works just like googling an image typically does, except it has the added function of allowing you to directly add the image to the information on your location point.\\
Make sure **Google Image Search** is selected. In the search bar, type the name of the place or other key words to help you find the images you would like to add and click the **blue button with the magnifying glass** or press your **enter** or **return** key on your keyboard to start the search.\\
{{https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7579/16045479527_baa97432e7_z.jpg}}\\
You can adjust the parameters of the search with the **any type** drop-down or the **color squares**.\\
{{https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7462/16230519732_e8a061d787_z.jpg}}\\
The **any type** drop-down allows you to choose why type of image you are looking for. Click on it and the drop-down with offer you other choices besides "any type." Click the option you would like to select it.\\
{{https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7581/16229466891_0faa4fd60f.jpg}}\\
The color squares allow you to select what colors you want in the images. A blue box will appear around the selected color squares.\\
To select an image to use, hover over the desired image with your mouse. You will see a black circle outlined in white with a white checkmark inside it.\\
{{https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7565/15611482783_4c0c093659_z.jpg}}\\
Click on the image to select it. The checkmark will turn blue and a blue outline will appear around the image. Then press the blue **select** button on the bottom left-hand of the window.\\
{{https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7539/15608920404_bfa0768ce1_z.jpg}}\\
Now you will see an image in the information window for your location point.\\
{{https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8683/16043950280_b15ec3a890_z.jpg}}\\
To add another image or video, select the **+** button in the bottom right-hand corner of the black image box.\\
{{https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8660/16045393239_1d82aaee87_z.jpg}}\\

=== Adding an Image Using Image URL ===
Adding an Image using Image URL requires you to have a URL to an already uploaded image. You **CANNOT** upload an image file from your computer; it must already be available online. If you have some photos saved on your computer that you would like to use, you can upload them to [[http://imgur.com/ | Imgur]] or [[http://flickr.com | Flickr]] and then add them to your location point information via Image URL.\\
To add an image using Image URL,starting from the location point information window, select the **camera** icon in the bottom right-hand corner if this is your first image or video for the location point\\ 
{{https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8605/15608920264_335dabf48c.jpg}}\\
or select **+** icon in the bottom right-hand corner if this is not your first image or video for the location point.\\
{{https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8660/16045393239_1d82aaee87_z.jpg}}\\
A window will appear with four options. Make sure the blue line is under **Image URL** to indicate that it is selected. You should see **Paste an image URL here:** with a bar highlighted in blue and a cursor blinking in it to the right of it.
{{https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7526/15609099584_7e211e3796_z.jpg}}\\
Paste the image URL into the bar. A checkmark should appear on the right side of the bar and your image should also appear. Then click the blue **select** button in the bottom left-hand side of the window.\\
{{https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7537/16045657657_dfc8be146b_z.jpg}}\\
You should see the image in the information window for your location point. If this is the second image or video you've added for the location point, you will also see that there is now an arrow for you to flip through the media.\\
