====== Printing with MakerBot Desktop ======

MakerBot Desktop is the newest version of MakerBot software that allows you to print 3D objects on a MakerBot 3D Printer.  

This tutorial is designed to guide you through the process of printing a 3D object. If you want to create your own object to print, please read the [[other-software-tools:3dprinting:tinkercad|Tinkercad tutorial]] before proceeding here.  

1. Go to [[http://www.makerbot.com/desktop#download]] and download the latest version of MakerBot Desktop and follow the installation steps.

2. Once downloaded, launch the application.

3. Click on **Devices** then **Select Type of Device** and choose the printer that you will use.  The ThinkLab houses the **Replicator (Dual)** printer and DTLT houses the **Replicator (5th Generation)**.  **MAKE SURE YOU CHOOSE THE CORRECT PRINTER, OTHERWISE YOUR OBJECT WILL NOT PRINT PROPERLY!**

4. Once you have chosen the correct printer, click **Prepare**. You should see a blank grid like the one shown below.

5. Click **Add File** and find the .stl file that you created using Tinkercad, and click **Open**.  The file should appear on the build platform.

6. Using the various buttons along the left-hand side of the screen, you can change the view of the platform, rotate and move the object, and change the size of it. The object must be selected!  It is always a good idea to make sure your object is centered on the build platform. Click **On Platform** and **Center** under the **Change Position** button.

**Please read the following steps carefully, as they differ for each type of printer!**

===== If you are using the Replicator Dual: =====


1. Insert an SD card into your computer. This card is similar to the memory cards used in digital cameras.  

2. Click on **Settings**.

3. Change the type of filament to say **MakerBot ABS** for both the right and left extruders.  If you have overhangs on your object, you will also want to turn on supports for the same extruder that you are printing from. Then click **Save Settings**.

4. Click **Export Print File**. When another window pops up, click **Export Now**.  The file should be saved as **.x3g** file type. Make sure to save it onto the SD card and not your computer! When you are finished, click **Save**.

5. After the file is saved to the SD card, eject the SD card and insert it into the slot on the printer. The slot is on the right hand side, directly behind the Navigation Menu.

6. Once the card is inserted, use the menu interface on the printer to find your file and print it. Your file will be located under the **Build from SD** menu.  

7. Once your object has finished printing, carefully remove it from the platform, as the platform may still be hot!



===== If you are using the Replicator 5th Generation: =====


1. Insert a USB drive into your computer.

2. Click on **Settings**.

3. Make sure the material says **MakerBot PLA**.  If you have overhangs on your object, you will also want to check the **Supports** box.  Then click **Save Settings**.

4. Click **Export Print File**. When another window pops up, click **Export Now**.  The file should be saved as **.makerbot** file type.  Make sure to save it onto the USB drive and not your computer! When you are finished, click **Save**.

5. After the file is saved to the USB, eject it and insert it into the slot on the printer. The slot is on the front of the printer, in the same area as the navigation menu.

6. Once the USB drive is inserted, use the menu interface on the printer to find your file and print it. Your file will be located under the **Build from SD** menu.  

7. Once your object has finished printing, carefully remove it from the platform, as the platform may still be hot!


====== **REMEMBER: THE REPLICATOR DUAL USES ABS FILAMENT AND THE REPLICATOR 5TH GENERATION USES PLA FILAMENT**
