====== Printing with MakerBot Desktop ======

MakerBot Desktop is the newest version of MakerBot software that allows you to print 3D objects on a MakerBot 3D Printer.  

This tutorial is designed to guide you through the process of printing a 3D object. If you want to create your own object to print, please read the [[other-software-tools:3dprinting:tinkercad|Tinkercad tutorial]] before proceeding here.  

1. Go to [[http://www.makerbot.com/desktop#download]] and download the latest version of MakerBot Desktop and follow the installation steps.

3. Click on **Devices** then **Select Type of Device** and choose the printer that you will use.  The ThinkLab houses the **Replicator (Dual)** printer and DTLT houses the **Replicator (5th Generation)**.  **MAKE SURE YOU CHOOSE THE CORRECT PRINTER, OTHERWISE YOUR OBJECT WILL NOT PRINT PROPERLY!**

5. Click **Add File** and find the .stl file that you created using Tinkercad, and click **Open**.  The file should appear on the build platform.

6. Using the various buttons along the left-hand side of the screen, you can change the view of the platform, rotate and move the object, and change the size of it. The object must be selected!  It is always a good idea to make sure your object is centered on the build platform. Click **On Platform** and **Center** under the **Change Position** button.
