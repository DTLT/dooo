====== Using Tinkercad ======

Tinkercad is an online tool for creating your own 3D objects that can be printed using a 3D printer. There are no boundaries when it comes to creating objects, so just experiment and play around with the different tools in Tinkercad and have fun!

16. To make multiple copies of an object, highlight the object, then click on **Edit**, then **Copy**.  Click **Edit**, then **Paste** and a copy of your object will appear on the workplane.  Using the **Duplicate** button will also work - only the second object will appear in //exactly the same spot// as the original, so you will have to drag one object around the workplane.
