==== Using the Epson Scanner ====

  - If the scanner is not on (green light on the front), the power button is on the lower right side.
  - Lift the lid of the scanner and place your item to be scanned on the glass - with the top facing down and pressed against the top right corner of the glass.
  - Do your best not to touch the glass as fingerprints can smudge the image. 
  - On the computer, open the **Image Capture** program.
  - You should see the Epson scanner listed under **Devices**. If you don't see it, check that the USB cable for the scanner is plugged into the computer.
  - Once open, the scanner will communicate with the software and do an "overview" scan.
  - Adjust the selection of the image in the preview window if needed.
  - Click the **Scan** button in the Image Capture software.
  - The default save location is the **Pictures** folder. Please do not change this!
