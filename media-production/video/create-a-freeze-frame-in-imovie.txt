**Create a Freeze Frame in iMovie**

**Ingredients:**

1 - Computer (Mac OS)

1 - Apple's iMovie program

1 - Video clip(s) that you want to get a freeze frame from
 
**Directions**

  - Open iMovie
  - Go to File → **New Movie**, or click the **New (+)** button and choose Movie
  - Select a Theme (to keep it simple choose No Theme), then click the **Create**, and give your movie a name.
  - Now you'll import your video clip(s) that you want to get a freeze frame from. Go to **File** → **Import Media**… or drag the video into the Event area.
  - Next select the clips that you have imported by highlighting them all with the mouse
  - Once clip or clips are selected, drag them into your Timeline or press the **E** key on your keyboard. All the clips will move into your timeline.
  - Now that your clip is in the timeline, play the clip and find the frame you want to have as a still image ("freeze frame").
  - Move the timeline indicator to that frame and click the mouse to lock it down.
  - Now choose the **Modify** Menu and select **Add Freeze Frame**. This will add a 4 second still image to the timeline.
  - Once it's in your timeline, you are able to adjust the length of the freeze frame by dragging the edge of the clip left or right.
