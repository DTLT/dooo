===== Ingredients =====

1 - Computer (Mac for this tutorial)

1 - External Hard Drive

===== Directions =====

**IMPORTANT** If there are files on the external hard drive, **BACK THEM UP**. All files will be erased during this procedure so if you want to save any files from the external hard drive you need to save them before this tutorial.

  - Plug the external hard drive into a USB port on the computer.
  - Open **Disk Utility**. This can be found either by using the mac's search function (the magnifying glass in the top right) or in the Utilities folder in Applications.
  - Select your external hard drive and navigate to the **Erase** tab.
  - Change the format to **ExFAT** using the drop down menu and name the drive whatever you'd like.
  - Select **Erase** and confirm the action in the window that appears.
