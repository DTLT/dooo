==== Ingredients ====

1 – Computer (PC or Mac)

1 – Apple’s iTunes program (current version as of this post, version 12)  – download here

1 – An Internet website that has a podcast feed

==== Directions ====

  - Navigate to the website that has a podcast feed. This type of site would not be the norm, so this is likely a site that makes it very obvious that there is a podcast associated with it, or a site that was recommended by someone you know. An example would be the [[http://www.npr.org/rss/podcast/podcast_directory.php?type=main|NPR Podcast Directory]].
