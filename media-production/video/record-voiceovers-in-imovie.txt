===== Recording Voiceovers in iMovie =====

===Ingredients:====
1 - Computer (Mac OS)

1 - Apple's iMovie program

1 - Video clips that need a Voiceover (narration) recording




==== Directions ====

  - Open iMovie
  - Go to **File → New Movie**, or click the **New (+)** button and choose Movie
  - Select a Theme (to keep it simple choose No Theme), then click the **Create**, and give your movie a name.
  - Now you'll import your video clip that you want to voiceover. Go to **File → Import Media…** or drag the video into the Event area.
  - Next select the clips that you have imported by highlighting them all with the mouse
  - Once clip or clips are selected, drag them into your Timeline or press the E key on your keyboard. All the clips will move into your timeline.
  - Next go to the Window menu and choose Record Voiceover, or you can press the V key on your keyboard.
  - Place your Timeline cursor at the point in your video where you want to start recording (you'll be able to move the voiceover audio where you want it after you record).
  - In the Playback window there will be three icons. X will close the Voiceover tool, the Microphone symbol starts the recording, and your Input Source Button.

8.	Click on the Input Source button

9.	Click on the drop down tab and make sure your input device is selected (in this tutorial we are using the built-in microphone)


** Once this is done, you will see your microphone symbol jumping up and down when you speak. If it is rising to the top when you are speaking your volume level is too high. You can adjust this by going back into your Input Source button and lowering the level of volume to your device, to a smaller amount. Do this until you’re comfortable with the level of volume you are putting out. **


10.	To start recording, click the Microphone Symbol in the middle (it will give you a three second countdown and then you are ready to begin speaking).

11.	When finished speaking, click the microphone symbol again and that will end your recording. 

12.	You can move this recording anywhere you want on the clip by clicking on the new audio strip and sliding left or right. 

13.	If you have audio on the original clip that you don’t want anymore simply right click the clip and select detach audio. 

14.	Once you see the separated audio from the video, right click on the strip and select delete.

15.	Now your clip has new audio you have recorded using the Voiceover tool.
