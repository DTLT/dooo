====== Ingredients ======

1 - Computer (Mac)

1 - Copy of Final Cut Pro X (version 10.1 or later)

1 - External Hardrive (some recommended drives are in this article - [[http://umwnewmedia.org/getting-started-with-final-cut-pro-x/|Getting Started With Final Cut Pro X]])

====== Directions ======

  - Go to File -> New -> Library. A new window will appear.
  - Select your external hard drive. It will be listed on the left panel of the finder window.
  - Fill in a title for the new library in the box at the top of the window. It may say untitled if you haven't chosen a name yet.
  - Select save in the bottom right of the window. The window will close, and now in the left panel where it says **Libraries**, the new library will be listed.
  - To reduce confusion, you can right click on the old library (the one created at the start of the project) and select **Close Library**. This will remove the selected library from the list.
  - Select **Import Media**. An import window will open with available media. It may be neccessary to navigate to the location of the media you would like to import.
  - Select the media, and press **Import Selected**.
  - Ensure that the event or library you are uploading to is correct, and click **Import**. The media will now begin to upload. The "progress circles" that appear on each clip show the progress of the import.
  - Create a new project either by going to File -> New -> Project or clicking **New Project** in the lower window.
  - Give the project a title and press **OK**. A timeline will now appear in the lower window where media can be added and then edited to create a new video.
  - Once you have finished, quit Final Cut Pro X and then be sure to **Eject** the drive. Now you can take your project with you.
