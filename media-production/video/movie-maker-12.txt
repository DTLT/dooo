Click [[http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=255475|here]] to download and install Movie Maker 12 if you don't already have it. It is typically included with the Windows Essentials 2012 pack. You will need to be using Windows to download and use Movie Maker. If you are using a Mac, use [[https://www.apple.com/mac/imovie/|iMovie]] instead.

Movie Maker 12 is really a very simple program to learn. First you'll want to have video to work with. You can get this from several sources. Maybe you want to work with a clip from a movie, or maybe you have video that you yourself recorded. As long as you have the file on your computer, and it is one of the [[http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-live/movie-maker-file-types-faq|accepted file extensions]], you can open it in Movie Maker by clicking the workspace to the right that says "**Click here to browse for videos and photos**."

Once you have your video file loaded, it should appear to the right of the screen.The video file will likely appear as one timeline, or one long thumbnail. To do basic editing on your video, you'll want to use **Video Tools**.

Through the Video Tools tab, you'll be able to make several basic edits to your video. You can control the video's volume, and you can have the audio fade in or out by different intervals. Other edits include the abilities to increase your video's speed, to split your video into parts, and to trim parts off of your video.

The most immediately useful tool here is the **Split** tool. By splitting your timeline, you'll be able to more easily control settings for different parts of your video. For example, if you want the first four minutes of your video to run at 2x speed and the rest to run at 1x speed, you can simply split the video at the four minute mark and then select that portion of the video to change its speed. To split your video, go to the time on your video that you'd like to split it at, you can do this with either the video controls to the left under the preview, or by moving the black bar on the timeline. Once you position it carefully, click **Split**. Now your video should be split into two parts at the time you chose. You can do this as much as you'd like. You can also use the split tool in lieu of the **Trim** tool by splitting parts of your timeline and then deleting them.

With your video split, you'll also be able to take advantage of many of the animations and visual effects Movie Maker has to offer. Oh, and keep in mind that splitting is not the only way to have multiple segments in your timeline; you can also use multiple video files at once with Movie Maker.
