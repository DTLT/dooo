1 – External hard Drive

==== Directions ====


----

1. Plug In External Hard Drive into Computer

(Pop-up may appear to ask if you would like to use External Hard Drive as a Back up with TIME Machine?)

In this case you are using the External Hard Drive for Final Cut Pro- so select the button (Don’t Use)

2. Now you need to format your drive for Final Cut- Two ways to do this:

*	Double Click Macintosh Hard Drive → Applications Folder → Utilities→ Disk Utility 
 
*	Magnifying Glass (For Search)- Type Disk Utility (Hit Enter to start program)

3. Next thing to do is go in and format the drive

*	Click on area that is the name of your external drive (Example: MY PASSPORT)

*	Select the Erase tab

* Format will Read: Windows NT File System (NTFS)- you will click on the drop down button where you read this to get the format you will use

*	Click on Mac OS Extended (Journaled)

*	Below after you make that selection, you are able to change the name of your External Hard Drive or keep it the way that it is. 

*	Finally click on the Erase Button on the bottom right of section. 

*	Pop- up will ask you again if you want to erase, click Erase again

(While it is erasing it will take the disk out, upload some temporary files, and erase the volume.)

After a few seconds you will basically have the pop-up that you had at the beginning when you plugged External Hard Drive into computer asking you : Do you want to use (name of your Hard Drive) to back up with Time Machine?

4. Click Don’t Use 

- Now your drive is formatted and ready to be used with Final Cut Pro X
