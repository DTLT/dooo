  - In the adjustment panel, where previously we had selected **Fit** to have the image fit the screen, we now want to select **Crop to Fill** to have the image fill the screen with the correct aspect ratio. You can adjust the position and size of the selected area by clicking and dragging the boundary box.
  - Next, we select **Color Correction**. Increase the saturation to make the subject look less washed out.
  - Return to the Video Overlay Settings adjustment panel.
  - Using the **Softness** slider, you can make small adjustments here. For most instances, somewhere in the middle of the slider will provide the best results.
  - For issues such as large shadows on the green screen, select the **Eraser** tool in the **Clean Up** area and then click where the shadow is. It should disappear.
  - Another technique for fixing large mistakes is using the **Crop** tool from the **Clean Up** area. Clicking this tool allows you to manipulate 4 white dots that appear in the corners to adjust what portion of the green screen footage gets "masked out". In the video, we are able to eliminate the corner of the computer that remains in the shot. Beware that over doing the cropping means you can crop out entire heads and body parts in your footage so be careful. It may be a good idea to practice these techniques before attempting to implement them in a major project.
