**Course Tags and Categories**

This course uses tag syndication, meaning that you will post your writing on your own UMW Blogs site, and it will be automatically copied into [[http://introws.umwblogs.org | the course's central site]]. The site you created during the in-class signup process should have the correct tag populated for you; if you are using a previously-created blog, or do not have the correct tags already in your site, you will need to use the tag **wgst101**. 

In addition, the central course site uses categories for organizational purposes, and each post you write needs to be assigned one or more categories. The site you created during the in-class signup process should have the correct categories populated for you; if you are using a previously-created blog, or do not have the correct categories already in your site, you will need to use one or more of the following:
  * Section1 (for all posts from students in section 1 of the course -- note there is no space!)
  * Section2 (for all posts from students in section 2 of the course -- note there is no space!)
  * Activism and Social Change
  * Discussion Prompts
  * Family
  * Feminism
  * Gender
  * In the News
  * Privilege
  * Religion
  * Reproductive Rights
  * Sexuality
  * The Body
  * The State and Social Policy
  * Violence
  * Women's and Gender Studies
  * Work and Occupations
