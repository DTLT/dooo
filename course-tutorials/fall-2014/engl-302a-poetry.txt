**Course Tags**

This course uses tag syndication, meaning that you will post your writing on your own UMW Blogs site, and it will be automatically copied into [[http://302poetry.umwblogs.org | the course's central site]]. The site you created during the in-class signup process should have the correct tag populated for you; if you are using a previously-created blog, or do not have the correct tags already in your site, you will need to use the tag **302poetry** on all posts.

In addition, the central course site uses categories for organizational purposes, and each post you write needs to be assigned one or more categories. The site you created during the in-class signup process should have the correct categories populated for you; if you are using a previously-created blog, or do not have the correct categories already in your site, you will need to use one or more of the following:
  * Section 1 (for all posts from students in section 1 of the course -- note there is no space!)
  * Section 2 (for all posts from students in section 2 of the course -- note there is no space!)
  * Journal 1
  * Journal 2
  * Journal 3
  * Journal 4
  * Poem 1
  * Poem 2
  * Poem 3
  * Poem 4
