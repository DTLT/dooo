**Course Tag: hist471-f1**

This course uses tag syndication, meaning that you will post your writing on your own UMW Blogs site, and it will be automatically copied into [[http://repubchina.umwblogs.org/ | the course's central site]]. To make this happen, you will need to use the following tag on all posts for this course, exactly as shown here: **hist471-f1** (don't forget the dash!)
