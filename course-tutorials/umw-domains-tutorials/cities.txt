====== GEOG 237: Cities ======

If you have questions or need help, please visit the Digital Knowledge Center (ITCC 408) and meet with a peer tutor. Drop-in assistance is available, but we highly recommend [[http://dkc.umw.edu | making an appointment]] to ensure you'll get the help you need.

**Course Tags**

This course uses tag syndication, meaning that you will post your writing on your own UMW Domains site, and it will be automatically copied into [[http://cities.melinapatterson.net | the course's central site]]. To make this happen, you will need to use the course tag, exactly as shown here: **geog237**

====== Creating a Site for This Course ======

For this class, you will need to set up a subdomain in which you'll install WordPress. You can call the subdomain anything you'd like; if you're not sure what to pick, consider using "cities" or something else similarly course-related (without the quotes, of course).

**PLEASE NOTE that when you install WordPress for this class, you should choose "GEOG 237: Cities" as a package option during the installation process.**
