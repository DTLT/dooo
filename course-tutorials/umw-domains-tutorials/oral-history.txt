====== Creating a Site for This Course ======

For this class, you will need to set up a subdomain in which you'll install WordPress. You can call the subdomain anything you'd like; if you're not sure what to pick, consider using "hist441," "oralhistory," or something else similarly course-related (without the quotes, of course).
