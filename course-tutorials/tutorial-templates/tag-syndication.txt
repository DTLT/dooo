====== Tag syndication ======

If you have questions or need help, please visit the Digital Knowledge Center (ITCC 408) and meet with a peer tutor. Walk-ins are available, but we highly recommend [[http://dkc.umw.edu | making an appointment]] to ensure you'll get the help you need.

**Course Tags**

This course uses tag syndication, meaning that you will post your writing on your own UMW Blogs site, and it will be automatically copied into [[ | the course's central site]]. To make this happen, you will need to use one or more of the following tags, exactly as shown here:
  * Course Tag 1
  * Course Tag 2
  * Course Tag 3
