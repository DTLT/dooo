===== Other Work =====
As this is our final week of the cohort there is no specific homework, however we would encourage you to move forward with building out your domain as the second piece of the Domain of One's Own Faculty Initiative. In addition to being eligible for an additional stipend, building out your domain to include your scholarship, teaching statement, CV, and other relevant information is a great way to continue to connect with your learning network and build out your professional presence on the web. For more information on the stipend see Mary Kayler and please also reach out to your cohort leader for one-on-one assistance as you work through that process.
