====== Week One: Understanding the Web ======

Spring 2014 Faculty Initiative

===== Reading & Review =====

One goal of Domain of One’s Own is to help participants develop a deeper understanding of how the Web actually works. Prior to the first meeting, we’ve chosen a set of readings/videos/resources to review that, we hope, will give you a better understanding of the the history and underpinnings of the Web.

===== Other Work =====
 
In addition, prior to the first meeting, you must register your own domain name and get a hosting account through Domain of One’s Own. You'll also need to install WordPress on your domain. 

If you already have a domain, you do not need to sign-up again. Similarly, if you already have WordPress installed, you can use your existing installation for the Faculty Initiative -- Or you can install another copy of WordPress. Ultimately, you will be blogging as part of your participation in the program, and you can decide if you would like to use an existing WordPress or a new one. 

The following tutorials will walk you through choosing a domain name, signing up on DoOO, and installing WordPress.
