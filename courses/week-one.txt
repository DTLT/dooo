====== Week One: Understanding the Web ======

Spring 2014 Faculty Initiative

===== Reading & Review =====

One goal of Domain of One’s Own is to help participants develop a deeper understanding of how the Web actually works. Prior to the first meeting, we’ve chosen a set of readings/videos/resources to review that, we hope, will give you a better understanding of the the history and underpinnings of the Web.

==== Other Work ====
 
In addition, prior to the first meeting, we want you to go ahead and register your own domain name and get a hosting account through Domain of One’s Own. You’ve each been added to our client system, so that you can sign up automatically. We’ve also put together a tutorial about choosing a domain and how to sign-up:
