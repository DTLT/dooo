#WordPress Themes 

When it comes to WordPress, customization is the name of the game. When you install WordPress, the default (or pre-set) theme is called **Twenty Thirteen** (as of WordPress version 3.7). It is a very customizable theme, though slightly garish to start with. You have the option of using one of your own images for the header of the site, and changing text color in the header. However, you may want a completely different look, and that's where installing new themes comes in.

As always, we start at the **Dashboard**.

Navigate to **Appearance > Themes**.

Your screen may look slightly different than the above example - Our demo site has the previous two WordPress themes installed  - "Twenty Twelve", and "Twenty Eleven". Installing new themes is quite simple. You start by going to the **Install Themes** tab.

The initial page is the Search Theme page, and it's not all that helpful (or visual). You can check a few "filter" boxes to see what comes up, but there is a more visual way. Click the **Featured** link at the top and you'll get visual (screenshot) examples of other themes you can install. You can also click "Newest" or "Recently Updated".

Under the thumbnail picture of each theme are three choices - **Install Now**, **Preview**, and **Details**. Those choices should be pretty self-explanitory so click **Install Now** to add a new theme to your site. After you install the theme, it is still not active on your site. You will need to **Activate** it to use it.

Once activated, your site will be using the new theme.

At the top of the page will be a message "New Theme Activated". Click on the **Visit Site** link to view your site with the new look.
