====== Advanced Wordpress Themes ======
After installing and activating the theme, your website will look very much like the template. Thus you will need to customize the theme to suit your desires. For this tutorial, I will be customizing the theme **Enigma**. If you are using a different theme, your options or experiences may differ (most themes have the same basic components, they just display them differently). However, these tips, tricks, and guides should give you a rough idea of the many possibilities there are for customizing your theme!

====== Tips & Tricks ======
I don't think there's any right way to customize a theme. This is all to your tastes. Most theme configuration involves playing around with the different options and seeing what changes what and if you like it. **WARNING: This can be a time-consuming process!**

My strategy is to work down the column on the left-hand side of the dashboard under **Appearance** following the category **Themes**, which is where you chose the theme that you are now about to customize, and work through all the columns and sections within each category. This ensures that you know what you've played around with and what you still have yet to explore.

The **Customize** category gives you an overview of all the basic aesthetic changes that you can make. The categories below it (**Widgets**, **Menus**, **Theme Options**, and **Backgrounds**) all provide more in-depth ways to manage the theme's appearance. **Editor** allows you to directly change the css.

====== Terminology ======
  * **Site Title**: This appears on the tab of your internet browser. It's like a name tag for the site, so that if you have multiple tabs open, you can easily see which one is which. 
  * **Tagline**: This appears both on the tab of your internet browser as well as on the home page of your theme. 
  * **Colors** or **Background Color**: These are the colors that will be in the background of your website or blog. When choosing them, consider how contrast and visibility factor into the appearance; you don't want something that makes it hard to read what's there. 
  * **Background Image**: If you don't want to have color as your background, you can upload an image to serve as your background. However, if your image is too busy, it might reduce how easily people can read or navigate your site. 
  * **Widgets**: These are independent sections of content that you can arrange and customize that appear on the sidebar of your blog or website.

===== How to Make a Subcategory in a Menu =====
  * In the menu section, select the categories or pages you want in the menu. 
  * To make one of the categories or pages a subcategory to the other one and thus appear below it when you mouse over the parent category or page, drag the child page or category to the right until it remains bumped over on the menu list.
