====== Changing the Theme ======

If you do not like the standard layout of the blog/website that is provided when starting your Wordpress site, you can choose different theme that is better suited to your purposes, style, or visual appeal. Follow the **Activating Themes** walkthrough over [[http://docs.umwdomains.com/wordpress/appearance-plugins/themes | here]]

To change your theme click the "Appearance" tab on the left side bar.

From there, select the "Themes" in the submenu. This will open a page where you can select from pre-screened themes for your blog. You can test them by hovering your mouse over them and selecting the **Live Preview** option. If you like a theme you can activate it by hovering your mouse over the theme and then clicking **Activate.**

So lets say you don't like the theme that is installed on your blog. So let's go look for different themes:
  * **Click** Add New Theme.

  * This will open the theme browser. From here you can search for a particular theme, browse the Featured themes, or the themes that are the most popular as well.

  * Once you have the theme you want to use, **hover** over that particular theme, you can see a preview of that particular theme. You also have the option to install the theme right away by **clicking** the install button.

  * This window will appear when the theme is installing.

  * Then you can view a live preview of the theme, that is tailored to what is on your blog at the moment.
