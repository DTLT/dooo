#Creating and Editing Menus


Creating a menu is how you can structure your site to show pages with content separated by their tags or show different pages with static information. This is also where you can relationally reorganize certain pages and make them sub-pages to parent pages.


To Edit your Menus click, "Appearance," on the left side bar. Then click, "Menus," on the submenu.
