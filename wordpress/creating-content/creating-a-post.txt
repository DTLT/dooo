====== Creating a Post ======

For some courses, you will need to create a post on your own personal blog; for others, you will need to create a post directly on the main course blog. Make sure you are on the correct Dashboard by looking in the menu across the top. If you are not in the right Dashboard, use the My Sites drop-down menu to go to the correct Dashboard. When in doubt, consult the syllabus, ask a classmate, or check with the professor.

1)  From the left sidebar, go to Posts -> Add New.

2)  In the Add Post editing area, enter a title for your post. Be descriptive, but not boring! Assignment #1, Paper #1, etc are NOT good titles. You may be asked to include specific items in your post titles, so when in doubt, consult the syllabus, ask a classmate, or check with the professor.

3)  Type your post into the larger text box. It's best to compose your text directly in the browser window, if possible. If you are pasting text from Microsoft Word, the visual editor will do its best to remove any extraneous formatting that may cause problems on your blog.

4)  You may be asked to add certain tags or categories to your post. Scroll down the Add Post page and look for the Categories and Tags widgets on the right side. 

**Categories:** If the category you need has already been created, you can simply check the box next to the right category. Otherwise, click the Add New Category link and enter the category name.

**Tags:** To see all existing tags on this blog, click the "Choose from the most used tags" link. If a tag that you want to use already exists, click on its name to apply it to your post. Otherwise, you can add tags by typing them into the box either one at a time or as a comma-separated list (e.g. ''summer, spring, fall'') before clicking Add.

When in doubt about what categories or tags to use, consult the syllabus, ask a classmate, or check with the professor.
