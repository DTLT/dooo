#Child Themes

==== What is a Child Theme? ====

A Child Theme is essentially a copy of a theme that is completely customizable. 

==== Why Should I Use Child Themes? ====

When you modify a WordPress theme, there is no guarantee that your modifications will be saved when the theme updates. A way to make sure that your edits to the theme last after updates is through creating a Child Theme. 

==== How Do I Make a Child Theme? ====
Making a Child Theme is very simple, but will require you to go into your Domain Of Own's Own File Manager. 

Steps:
  - **Login** to your [[http://umw.domains|Domain of Own's Account]].
  - When you login, you will see your Domain of One's Own Dashboard. Scroll down until you see **File Manager** located under //Files// and click on it. {{https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3930/15227866138_7b5ceb850e.jpg}}
  - A //File Manager Directory Selection// will appear. In it, make sure the the **Document Root for:** bubble is clicked. You need to also **select the domain or subdomain** you wish to create a Child Theme for. You can leave "show hidden files" checked. Then, click the **Go** button. This will take you to your //cPanel File Manager//. {{https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2950/15227866128_103fa7d39f.jpg}}
  - Next, you will see several folders both in the center and on the left hand side of the screen. Find the blue folder called **wp-content** and double click on it. If you are creating a Child Theme for a **directory**, double click on the blue folder with your directory name and then double click on the blue folder called **wp-content**.{{https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2948/15227925177_1223738bf6_c.jpg}}
  - Once in the //wp-content folder// you will see more blue folders. Click on the folder called **themes**. This folder holds all of your installed WordPress themes. {{https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2942/15414125402_61b5cdc993_o.png}}
  - In the //themes// folder you will see folders with the titles of your installed themes. What you want to do in order to create a Child Theme is click on **New Folder**, located at the top of the page. {{https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3928/15227716909_dcfc9c5310_c.jpg}}
  - In the text area for **New Folder Name** name it something that will let you know that it is a Child Theme. For example, if you want to make a Child Theme for Twenty Thirteen, then name your your child theme folder "twentythirteen-child." Then click **Create New Folder**. {{https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2946/15227866208_695da25779_o.png}}
  - Next, double click your new Child Theme folder to go inside of it. {{https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2943/15411288061_301f13e306_o.png}}
  - Now add a **New File** by clicking on the new file icon at the top of the screen. {{https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3928/15411288081_40970b6a83_o.png}} 
  - When naming the new file, this time you MUST name it **style.css**. {{https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3927/15227925197_44f311fe57_o.png}}
  - After that new file is made, open it up by selecting it and clicking on **Edit** at the top of the screen.  Click on **Edit** when the Text Editor box appears. 
  - Once inside your file, you need to add this code to the file. Copy the code in bold below and paste it into your file. 
<html><strong>
/*
 Theme Name:   Twenty Fourteen Child
<br />
 Theme URI:    http://example.com/twenty-fourteen-child/
<br />
 Description:  Twenty Fourteen Child Theme
<br />
 Author:       John Doe
<br />
 Author URI:   http://example.com
<br />
 Template:     twentyfourteen
<br />
 Version:      1.0.0
<br />
 Tags:         light, dark, two-columns, right-sidebar, responsive-layout, accessibility-ready
<br />
 Text Domain:  twenty-fourteen-child
*/
<br />
<br />
@import url("../twentyfourteen/style.css");
<br />
<br />
/* =Theme customization starts here
-------------------------------------------------------------- */
</strong></html>

  - Once you have the code pasted into your file, you MUST change at the //very minimum// the **Theme Name**, the **Template**, and the **@import url**.
  - Tailor your **Theme Name**, the **Template**, and the **@import url** to what your Parent Theme's name is. For example, if I wanted to make a Child Theme of the theme Twenty Thirteen, I would change the text to look like so:

<html><strong>
/*
 Theme Name:   Twenty Thirteen Child
<br />
 Template:     twentythirteen
<br />
<br />
@import url("../twentythirteen/style.css");
<br />
<br />
/* =Theme customization starts here
-------------------------------------------------------------- */
</strong></html>

  - After you have changed the Child Theme input names to your Parent theme's names, you can click on **Save Changes** in the upper right hand corner.

==== Activating a Child Theme ====
Your child theme is now installed! Now you need to activate it. 
  - **Login** to your WordPress site. 
  - Once in your Dashboard, go to **Appearance** then **Themes** on the left sidebar. 
  - You will now see a your child theme there! Click on **Activate** to make it your theme. 

==== Editing a Child Theme ====
As you can see, your newly activated Child Theme looks exactly like your Parent Theme. This is because the Child Theme pulls all of the design and structural elements from the Parent Theme. In order to make customizations, you need to edit your Child Theme. There are two ways you can go about editing your Child Theme. 

=== Option 1: ===
 You can go back into your **File Manager** and make your edits there in the **style.css file** underneath 

/* =Theme customization starts here -------------------------------------------------------------- */ 

  
=== Option 2: ===
 You can add in your edits using the WordPress Dashboard interface. To do so, go to **Appearance** and then **Editor** in the left sidebar of the Dashboard. 
Type into the text area under **Stylesheet (style.css)**, and then **Save** your changes.
