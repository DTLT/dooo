#Child Themes

==== What is a Child Theme? ====

A Child Theme is essentially a copy of a theme that is completely customizable. 

==== Why Should I Use Child Themes? ====

When you modify a WordPress theme, there is no guarantee that your modifications will be saved when the theme updates. A way to make sure that your edits to the theme last after updates is through creating a Child Theme. 

==== How Do I Make a Child Theme? ====
Making a Child Theme is very simple, but will require you to go into your Domain Of Own's Own File Manager. 

Steps:
  - **Login** to your [[http://umw.domains|Domain of Own's Account]].
  - When you login, you will see your Domain of One's Own Dashboard. Scroll down until you see **File Manager** located under //Files// and click on it. 
  - A //File Manager Directory Selection// will appear. In it, make sure the the **Document Root for:** bubble is clicked. You need to also **select the domain or subdomain** you wish to create a Child Theme for. You can leave "show hidden files" checked. Then, click the **Go** button. This will take you to your //cPanel File Manager//.
  - Next, you will see several folders both in the center and on the left hand side of the screen. Find the blue folder called **wp-content** and double click on it. If you are creating a Child Theme for a **directory**, double click on the blue folder with your directory name and then double click on the blue folder called **wp-content**.
  - Once in the //wp-content folder// you will see more blue folders. Click on the folder called **themes**. This folder holds all of your installed WordPress themes. 
  - In the //themes// folder you will see folders with the titles of your installed themes. What you want to do in order to create a Child Theme is click on **New Folder**, located at the top of the page. 
  - In the text area for **New Folder Name** name it something that will let you know that it is a Child Theme. For example, if you want to make a Child Theme for twentyfourteen, then name your your child theme folder "twentyfourteen-child." Then click **Create New Folder**. 
  - Next, double click your new Child Theme folder to go inside of it. 
  - Now add a **New File** by clicking on the new file icon at the top of the screen.  
  - When naming the new file, this time you NEED to name it **style.css**. 
  - After that new file is made, open it up by selecting it and clicking on **Edit** at the top of the screen.  Click on Edit when the Text Editor box appears. 
  - Once inside your file, you need to add this code to the file. Copy the code in bold below and paste it into your file.
