# Permalinks

Part of the popularity of WordPress is how easily it makes a website functional and yet attractive. One of the smaller details that you might want to adjust is how the addresses to your blog posts are structured. **Permalink** is the name given to the address of an individual blog post because they are "permanent links". For example, the web address for our sample blog is [http://www.umwdomains.com/demo/](http://www.umwdomains.com/demo/). The link to the first post, titled "Hello World" may be structured in many ways. The screenshot below shows one way.

So [http://www.umwdomains.com/demo/blog/](http://www.umwdomains.com/demo/blog/) may get you to that blog post, but it's a little vague. With WordPress, you have many options to form the links to posts, and you can change them to specifically tailor each post. To change the permalink structure, start by going to the **Dashboard**.

Next, go to **Settings > Permalinks**.

As you can see, there are several choices under **Common Settings**. The Default setting gives us that uninformative "?p=123". A popular choice is to use the **Post name** choice, which is a bit more informative. So our post titled "Hello World" will have an address of [http://www.umwdomains.com/demo/uncategorized/hello-world/](http://www.umwdomains.com/demo/uncategorized/hello-world/).

If you want to have the date as part of the address, you can choose **Day and name** or **Month and name**. You can also change the structure of category and tag names under the **Optional** section.

Finally, when you write a blog post, you have the option of editing the permalink for an individual post. Just click the **Edit** button (underneath the Title field).

Then type in whatever is appropriate (and hasn't been used yet). Generally you want to make it as simple and short a word, or words, as makes sense. In the example below, we get a little silly with the O's.
