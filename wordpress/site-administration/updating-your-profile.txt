====== Updating Your Profile ======

Your profile contains identifying information about you, including your display name, email address, password, and avatar. To access your profile, make sure you are logged into UMW Blogs, and look in the top right-hand corner of the browser window. You should see a welcome message, along with a small picture.

To access and/or update your profile, hover your mouse over the "Howdy" message, and click the Edit My Profile link that appears in the drop-down menu.

==== Updating Your Name ====

Most WordPress theme display information about the author of a post; by default, because UMW Blogs has very little information about you, it uses the username you created as your name. To choose how your name should be displayed throughout UMW Blogs:

1) Fill out the Name area of your profile.

2) Use the Display Name Publicly As drop-down menu to pick how others will see you. 

The only box that must be filled out in this area is the nickname; if you are uncomfortable in having your real name displayed on UMW Blogs, pick a pseudonym and let your professors know what name you are using.

==== Changing Your Password ====

When you first signed up for UMW Blogs, you were given a random (and probably hard to remember) password. To update that password to something you can remember:

1)  Scroll to the bottom of the Profile page.

2)  Enter your new password in the New Password and Repeat New Password boxes.

3)  Click Update Profile to save your changes.

The new password will take effect immediately.

==== Setting up your Gravatar ====

Many areas of WordPress display a small image next to your name (for example, in the Howdy menu in the top-right corner of the window). To update this image, you can use a free service called Gravatar (Globally Recognized Avatar). This service allows you to create an account, input one or more email addresses that you use, and then to associate pictures with those email addresses.

To change your UMW Blogs avatar:

1)  Visit the [[http://gravatar.com|Gravatar home page]] and sign up for an account with your @mail.umw.edu email address. 

2)  Upload a picture (of yourself, a pet, etc) into Gravatar, and ask it to associate that image with your @mail.umw.edu email address.

3)  Save your changes, and within a little while, UMW Blogs will automatically begin associating the image you uploaded with your UMW Blogs account. This doesn't always happen immediately, so you may need to wait for this to happen.

Other Notes:
  * If you have trouble creating your Gravatar, try checking [[https://en.gravatar.com/support/|the Gravatar support site]].
  * Gravatars are usually displayed as a small image, so for best results, use a square image in which a single subject takes up most of the space.
  * The account you create on Gravatar can also be used to access WordPress.com. Although WordPress.com uses the same underlying software that UMW Blogs does, these two usernames/passwords are completely separate from one another, and are not interchangable. That said, having a WordPress.com account can provide you with access to a number of other features and services, so it's a good idea to create one.
