====== Managing Comment Spam with Akismet ======

SPAM! Everyone hates it in their email. If you're new to WordPress and blogging platforms, spam exists in the form of comment spam - people (or vermin) leave comments promoting their services or schemes, on a post or page.

So how do you deal with comment spam when it can come in even more often than email spam? Do you have to delete every comment that comes in? Well, the answer to the second question is "no", and the answer to the first question is, with a plugin called [[http://akismet.com/|Akismet]].

To get started we need to activate the plugin. To do this, we'll start at the **Dashboard**.

Navigate to **Plugins > Installed Plugins**.

At or near the top of the list of plugins that are automatically installed in a new WordPress installation, is [[http://wordpress.org/plugins/akismet/|Akismet]]. You need to make the plugin active on your site by click the "Activate" link.

As soon as you activate the plugin, a box will appear at the top of your page with a button to activate your Akismet account. You should click the button.

Your Akismet Settings page will appear. It will request an "API Key." API stands for Application Programming Interface, and it's a way for programs and services to "talk" to each other. The Akismet plugin requires you to get an **Akismet API Key**, which is simply a "code" that you supply when activating the plugin. The key is free if you use it on a personal WordPress installation, and you can click the "Get Your API Key" in order to set it up.

Once you arrive on the Akismet for WordPress site, click the **Get an Akismet API key** button.

If you have an account at [[http://wordpress.com/|WordPress.com]] you can sign in with that login and get your key. Otherwise, fill in an email address, a username, and a password to use for a new account. Click the **Sign up** button to proceed.

Click on the **Sign Up** button under the Personal plan (that is if you want it to be the free version). When you get to the next page, the recommended contribution is $36. You can adjust the slider down to $0. The smiley face will begin to frown, but at least your key will be free.

Also fill in your name and click **Continue**.

You're finished with the sign up process for your key, and it will be displayed on the page for you (we've blurred ours out). Now follow the steps that they show you for using your new key. You will enter the key on the Akismet settings page:

**An additional note**: If you installed Wordpress through Domain of One's Own using Installatron you will also have another spam plugin "Cookies for Comments" activated automatically which helps to catch spam that Akismet might not.
