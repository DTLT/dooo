====== Managing Permissions ======


The default Mediawiki install on Domain of One's Own has been customized to make it a bit harder for spammers to overwhelm wikis with illegitimate content and comments. This is done by modifying the **LocalSettings.php** file (a file that is included in every install in which it is possible to provide configurations details). 

By default, Mediawiki allows anonymous users to create pages and edit pages in the wiki. The DoOO modifications changes this in the following way: 


  * Anonymous users cannot edit existing pages
  * Anonymous users cannot create pages
  * Registered users must click the confirmation link in the registration email in order to edit or create pages

This approach should drastically reduce unsolicited content and comments on Mediawiki installations. One further step that faculty member (who might be using a Mediawiki for a course) might take is to turn registration off after a predetermined amount of time. Students must create accounts by this date; after that, the settings are changed so that registrations are no longer open. 

To add this setting, you must edit **LocalSettings.php** in your Mediawiki install: 

1. Login to cPanel and browse to your [[cpanel:accessing-your-files-through-the-file-manager|File Manager]]. 
2. In the File Manager, browser to the folder within public_html that contains your Mediawiki install. If you installed the wiki at the root of your domain, you won't need to go any further than public_html. If you installed the wiki in a subdomain or subdirectory, you'll need to find the directory that is associated with that space. 
3. Locate **LocalSettings.php** and click the **Edit** or **Code Editor** icon at the top of the File Manager. 
4. Browse to the bottom of the document, and locate the custom settings that were added during the Mediawiki install and the line "$wgGroupPermissions['*']['createaccount'] = false;" {{http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7305/11953831465_8e29aea940_z.jpg}}
