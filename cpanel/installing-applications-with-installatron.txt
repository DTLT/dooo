====== Installing Applications with Installatron======

<html><p>Domain of One's Own makes use of a special script installer called Installatron. This allows to quickly and easily install Web applications to your new Web space. By default, when you use Installatron, the application you add will be automatically upgraded whenever a new version is available (and a backup will be kept, just in case).&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have specific instructions for installing several scripts using Installatron (<a href="http://umwdomains.com/support/knowledgebase.php?action=displayarticle&amp;id=6">WordPress</a>, <a href="http://umwdomains.com/support/knowledgebase.php?action=displayarticle&amp;id=16">Omeka</a>, ZenPhoto, <a href="http://umwdomains.com/support/knowledgebase.php?action=displayarticle&amp;id=13">MediaWiki</a>, OwnCloud), but below you'll find general instructions about how to install any application using Installatron.
