====== Introduction to cPanel ======


Your Web hosting account on Domain of One's Own is managed through a control panel interface called cPanel. [[https://cpanel.net/ | cPanel]] is an industry-standard tool for managing your domain and hosting. Using this tool, you can do all kind of thing with your Web space including the following:

  * install Web applications
  * create email accounts
  * view and manage files in your space
  * create subdomains
  * create and configure FTP accounts
  * review access logs for your site
  * manually manage and configure databases

Accessing cPanel has become even easier now! All you need to do is login at [[UMW domains|umw.domains]] and your website's cPanel will automatically be displayed upon login. You'll need to enter the user ID/password that was included in the email you received during the Domain of One's Own signup process (Subject: New Account Information).

Once you're logged in, you'll see the cPanel interface. It is divided into sections, making it easy to locate the different tools and services available to you. 

Many of the tutorials on this site walk you through particular tasks in cPanel, but we encourage you to explore on your own, as well.
