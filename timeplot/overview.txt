====== Overview ======


Timeplot is a Javascript application that allows users to take data files in the .txt and .xml format and create a timeline visualization of data. It also allows users to overlay events with clickable information bubbles to explain certain events that may have impacted trends in the data. There are many options to improve the the display of data, readability, and organization of the data.


There are three components to timeplot that need to be placed into their own folder, in your file manager of your domain. An .html file (linking to and containing some javascript), and two text files (one plain text file, and one XML file).

The text file (which uses a .txt extension) is the file that holds the raw data that the Javascript code reads into the program to create the data points. When plotted correctly, the x-axis of the Timeplot will display dates and the y-axis will display the variable data. Below is an example snippet of what the .txt file looks like.

The XML file (which uses the .xml extension) contains information about events that you want to plot against your numerical data. It is also read in by the Javascript code in the .html file. It is specially structured so that the javascript can read it. Below is an example snippet of what the .xml file looks like.

The .html file is what holds the Javascript code that controls the programs functionality and appearance.
