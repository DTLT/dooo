====== Advanced Tutorial =====

Once you've created a basic Timeplot, with a single line of data plotted, you may decide that you want to place additional data on your graph. This tutorial will cover adding two different kinds of data: 

  * additional numerical data, which will result in a new "line" on your graph and 
  * event information, which will result in a line or band for each event you wish to plot. 

This tutorial will walk you through adding this additional data. 

=====Creating Additional Lines on a Timeplot=====

====Adding the Data====
In order to add an additional plotted data line to your Timeplot, you will need to have a source for the data. The easiest way to do this is to edit your data.txt file and add a "column" to the comma-delimited file. 

The two images below demonstrate how to add data to your existing file. The first shows a data file with one "column" of text (President Bush's approval ratings). In the second picture, two additional data sets have been added (disapproval and unsure ratings). You should see how adding an additional data set simply involves appending the numerical data to each data, separating it from the original data with a comma.

====Adding the Line====

To create additional lines on the graph you will need to add a few lines of code to your HTML file. 

First, locate the block of code that starts with the line

<code javascript>
var plotInfo = [
</code>

You  will need to copy the block of text directly below this line:

Note that in the image above, the red box clearly identify where you should start/end the block you need to copy and paste. 

Next, you must paste the block you copied directly below the first one. (In order to fit both blocks in the image below, we've removed the inline comments):

Now, you must edit the second block of data. The image below shows were you should (or can) make edits to the code you just pasted:

  - You MUST provide a new id for new the new line you are plotting. 
  - You MUST indicate what "column" contains your data in your Text file. (See above) In this case, we'll be pulling in the second column for the second line of data. 
  - You can change the grid color for the y-axis (valueGeometry).
  - You can change the grid placement for the y-axis (valueGeometry).
  - You can change the grid color for the y-axis (timeGeometry).
  - You can change the grid placement for the y-axis (timeGeometry).

===== Adding points on the graph =====

If you would like to dots to your data points to make the data points more pronounced simply add the line 
" dotColor: "(Hex Value)" , " to block of color options in your graph line.

How it should look if you add this line is shown below.
