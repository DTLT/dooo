====== Creating a Text (Data) File using Wikipedia Data & Google Drive (Spreadsheets) ======

This tutorial will walk you through creating your text/data file using population data from Wikipedia and Google Drive (to edit and prepare it). Please note that we still recommend copying and pasting your data into the sample Text File that is created by Installatron when you install Timeplot. This will prevent you from having to upload a new file and then change the Timeplot code to point to that new file. 

===== Getting Your Data from Wikipedia =====

First, you'll need to browse to a Wikipedia page that contains population data for a city. For this example, we are using the city of Wichita, Kanas. Most US city pages in Wikipedia contain historical population data in the Demographics section of the page. You will need to scroll to find this data.

Using your mouse, select and copy the data in the population table. Make sure you select every available year and the associated population number before you copy.

===== Working with Your Data in Google Spreadsheets =====

Login to [[http://drive.google.com|Google Drive]] and create a new spreadsheet. Click the **Create** button and then choose **Spreadsheet**.

Place your cursor in the top-left cell of the spreadsheet, and paste the data that you copied from Wikipedia.

==== Removing Extra Rows & Columns ====

You may end up with extra empty rows or columns of data that you do not need. Remove everything but the year column and the population data column next to it.

**To delete rows:** 

Click on a row number to select the entire row and right-click. From the menu that appears, choose **Delete row**.

**To delete columns:**

Click on a column number to select the entire column and right-click. From the menu that appears, choose **Delete column**.

==== Formatting Date ====

The dates that you will copy and paste from Wikipedia will be in the form of only a year number. You will need to expand these to a standard date format (YYYY-MM-DD) in order for them to work properly in Timeplot. However, before you begin to edit these, you should change the format of the cell to **Plain Text**. This will prevent Google Spreadsheets from trying to automatically detect and format a date when you enter it. 

Select the column containing the years, go to **Format** -> **Number** -> **Plain Text**.

Now, edit each date column so that it also contains a month and day. We recommend just using "-01-01" (or January 1st) for each year.

==== Formatting Data ====

Your population data will probably have commas in the numbers to indicate thousands. You need to remove these since we will be exporting the data as a "comma separated value" file and the commas in the number will conflict with the commas used to delimit the data. You can remove them manually by editing your numbers, or you can reformat the cells. 

To reformat the cells, select the column containing the data, go to **Format** -> **Number** -> **More Formats** -> **Custom number format**.

In the dialog that appears, choose the first formatted listed (without commas) and click **Apply**.

You should now see the commas removed from your numbers. 

==== Exporting Your Data ====

The final step is exporting your spreadsheet as a Comma Separated Value (.csv) file. From the **File** menu, choose **Download as** -> **Comma-separated values** 

This will save the file to your computer. Choose a name and location for the file when prompted. 

==== Viewing Your Data ====
To check that your .csv file is properly formatted, we recommend opening the file you just opened in a text editor. On the Mac, we recommend TextEdit which should be part of the standard Mac operating system install. On the PC, we recommend Notepad which should be part of the standard PC operating system install. 

Do not open the file in Excel (or other spreadsheet editing software). If you do, you may find the program reformats the data in ways that won't work with Timeplot. 

==== Sharing Your Data ====
In order to share your data with the rest of the class, you'll need to create a file in the shared Google folder that your professor created for you. Unfortunately, if you upload the .csv file, Google will automatically convert it into a spreadsheet (requiring you to again export it as .csv file in order to use it with Timeplot). Instead, we recommend creating a blank word processing document and then pasting the text from your .csv file that you opened in a text editor on your computer. 

To create a word processing document, login to Google Drive, click **Create**, and choose **Document**.

Once in the document, simply paste the contents of the .csv file on your computer into the document.
