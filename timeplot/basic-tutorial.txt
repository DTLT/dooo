====== Basic Tutorial ======

This tutorial is a walk through of the basic code of the program. It has also been labeled for your convenience. Please ignore areas that are not labeled. Any changes to the code that is not intentional or unspecified areas will most likely cause it to not work. Please save your work often, so that you can revert to a version that works for ease of use.


To make changes to the code for your timeplot, you will need to click on the individual files and then select code editor from the top tool bar of the file manager to edit the files.

A pop up window will appear, leave the settings as is and click edit in the bottom left corner.

===== Designing Data Files =====

One of the most basic and most important parts of this program is to design and use a specific format for the data files. Open the .txt or .xlm files preferably with the code editor tool, but you can also use the text editor in the file manager or offline use a text editor like notepad (Windows) or text wrangler (Mac). You need to follow a style like the one shown below or experiment with a new one that meets your projects requirements.

==== Editing the text File ====

For our example we are going to format it similar to what is below.

{{:timeplot:inside_the_data_file.png?|}}

So in blue we have the date, Red is the approve, yellow is disapprove, and green is the unsure. You can see that there was also the comment at the top that explains that as well. You should comment your code and data files as much as possible so you and others can understand what is going on. To use a comment use the "#" key to tell the code to ignore everything on that line. This only will work in the data file though when the program is trying to read in the data.

An important part is the comma between our data. Later we will use that as a Delimiter, this tells the code program where one data entry stops and a new one begins. Now if you are using someone else's data file and they use a different delimiter, you can specify that later in the code as needed, just remember that you can only use one delimiter and it will read that key wherever it appears in your data, there is no way to exclude it. 

In the next step this will be explained more but you also need to design your data in another way.
Once your code reads it in, it also sees it as columns, from where the commas are,  and rows, from where the line ends (it is not shown but there really is computer code in the blank spot where the enter key was pressed).

So imagine it like this:

{{:timeplot:inside_the_data_file_2.png?|}}


The first column to the computer is column or point 0, the second column is 1, and so on and so forth. Remember this for editing the code later, each column can and will be its own graph.

Later on you will use that column position (0,1,2,.....X) to specify in your graph code where it will be getting the data to create that graph. 

The Horizontal axis is the data and the Vertical axis is the value in that column that you will specify.

===== How to get data into the program =====

Close to the bottom in this block of text is where you specify to the program where to get the information from. It can use a variety of file types but for this example were are using .txt data. 

{{:timeplot:date_file_location_code.png?|}}

As you can see in the photo above can see there is a lot going on in this small block of code. 
The text underlined in blue **must match exactly** the file type that is in quotes and that is underlined in orange. This is telling the program what the file type is and what the name of the file is called. One thing to note is that the file being named must be in the same folder in the document manager as the program file / index.html file.

The part in yellow is a "Delimiter," this tells the code program where one data entry stops and a new one begins. So what it will do is going into your "data.txt" file and start reading the entries and then once it sees whatever is in that place, right now a comma, it will end that entry and start a new one. 


===== How to edit the code =====

==== Adding and editing an additional graph ====

To add an Additional Graph you need to insert this block of code below the previous block of graph code and above the code block for the events.

{{:timeplot:graph_code.png?|}}

Explanation of Points
You must change 1 and 2 when adding a new graph.

  - You will need to make a new, unique name for your plot, just make the number of plots you have.
  - This is where the building of the raw data is going to come back. This tells the code what column you want data to come from to make that graph.
  - This is where you can specify the color for the line of your graph to be, using HTML Hexadecimal Code
  - Here you can also specify if you want the graph to have an infill color too. See the following section for changing color.
  - This point is where you can decide if you want your data to be shown when you put your mouse over it. If you want it shown set it to "true," if you do not want it to be shown set it to "false."

Here is the code in case you need to copy and paste it into the file. You can also find more code blocks under the quick code blocks page.

<code>


      Timeplot.createPlotInfo({
      id: "plot2",
      dataSource: new Timeplot.ColumnSource(eventSource,2),
      timeGeometry: timeGeometry,
      valueGeometry: valueGeometry,
      
      <!--These are the colors of your second graph-->
      
      lineColor: "#0000FF",
      showValues: true
    }),
 
</code>
==== Editing Colors ====

The program uses hexadecimal code to specify the color to the program of what you want your colors to be. It is very helpful to use another website to help you visualize the colors and get the codes. For example w3schools has a very helpful HTML color picker. You can find the link [[http://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_colorpicker.asp|here]] to get different "Hex" values for colors. 

Line Color: In the previous section it was number 3 in the Graph code to specify the color of the line.

Infill Color: This was number 4 in the previous section where you can change to code to get a different color


In the advanced tutorial there is also more information on additional color options.


==== Editing Events ====

There really isn't that much extra in the HTML index file to edit here, but it needs to be listed last.
There is also a line were you can specify the color for the events lines.

Here is the code for events:

{{:timeplot:event_code.png?1000|}}





==== Common Errors ====

For those of you that don't have a background in coding this will be a little bit more difficult, but for those that do this will make sense.

One of the most common errors is forgetting commas during coding. You need to put a comma after each point line in the graph seen here in points 2 and 3. You can remove some lines, but just make sure that the last line doesn't have a comma after it.
