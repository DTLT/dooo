====== Basic Tutorial ======

So in this tutorial we will be using the data that was automatically installed in your directory through Installatron. 

First log into your domain of one's own account at [[http://www.umwdomains.com|umwdomains.com]].

In the Dashboard, scroll down and click on the File Manager. Then select "Web Root" from the pop up window and click "Go". You may want to review the tutorial on the file manager [[http://docs.umwdomains.com/cpanel/accessing-your-files-through-the-file-manager|here]].

Inside you should see three types of files; a ".txt", a ".xml", and a ".html". Each on of these files is necessary to the running of the program. The .txt will house your raw data, the .xml holds your event dates and information, and the .html is the program code.

So this is is the code you should see when you open the "index.html" file:
