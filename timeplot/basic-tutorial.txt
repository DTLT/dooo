====== Basic Tutorial ======

This tutorial will use the installation package that was covered in the previous with the base file.[[timeplot:installation|Installation]] tutorial.

**A few things to note:**

This is a walk through of the code of the program in the HTML Javascript file. It has been labeled for your convenience. Please follow these instructions **exactly** as they are and ignore areas that are not labeled. Any changes to the code that is unintentional or in unspecified areas can cause it to not work. Please save your work often, so that you can revert to a version that works for ease of use.


To make changes to the code for your timeplot, you will need to click on the individual files and then select **code editor** from the top toolbar of the file manager to edit the files.

A pop up window will appear, leave the settings as is and click edit in the bottom left corner.

To view the timeplot as you edit the code you can type "www.mydomain.com/timeplot" and your browser will open that file, run the timeplot code, and display the graph. 

===== Step One: Adding Data =====

To get started we need to specify to the program where our raw data is and how to read that raw data so it will be read into the program. To tell the program we need to add this line of code to the program. With your installation package you were given a sample raw data text file and we will use that. 

Later if you decide to use your own data file there are some adjustments you may have to make here. You must make sure that the file is in in the same fold in the file manager and that your file name is spelled exactly as it appears in the file manager folder. You may also have to specify the delimiter, the comma in the parenthesis in the code. 

<code> 
  var eventSource = new Timeplot.DefaultEventSource();

  dataSource: new Timeplot.ColumnSource(eventSource,1),

  timeplot.loadText("data.txt", ",", eventSource);
</code>

Place this line of code as show below.
