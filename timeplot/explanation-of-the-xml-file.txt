===== Explanation of the XML File =====

The XML file (which uses the .xml extension) contains information about events that you want to plot against your numerical data. It is also read in by the Javascript code in the main HTML file. It is specially structured so that the javascript can read it. 

In order to successfully create a Timeplot you must use a specific format for the XML file. You may either create your XML file from scratch (using the format described below) or edit the sample XML file that is created when you install Timeplot using Installatron.

=====To Create an XML File from Scratch=====

An XML file is really just a special "flavor" of a text file, so you will need to use a text editing program on your computer to create your XML file. On Windows computers we recommend Notepad (free with the Windows operating system). On Macintosh computers we recommend Text Wrangler ([[http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/|Download for free here.]])

Remember when you save your file to use the .xml extension!

=====Format of the XML File=====

Whether you're creating an XML file from scratch or modifying a sample file, the ultimate format will be the same. The format of the file consists, generally, of each event on a single line, with information properly formatted so that it can be read by the Timeplot Javascript. 

The image below shows a snippet of the default event XML file that will be created if you you install Timeplot using Installatron on Domain of One's Own. (It shows events that correspond with the President George W. Bush approval ratings data that is contained in the default text file  created when you use Installatron to install Timeplot.)

You can see that each event is contained within an tag titled "event," and they contain three individual values: 
  * start: The date (and time, if appropriate) of the event. 
  * title: The title of the event (this will appear in a pop-up bubble on the Timeplot)
  * link: An (optional) URL that users can click on for more information about the event. 

Please note that all values must be contained in quotation marks. In addition, you must include the closing forward slash before you close the event tag: 

<code xml>
<event start="YOUR DATE GOES HERE" title="YOUR TITLE GOES HERE" link="YOUR URL GOES HERE" />
</code>

You may add as many events as you like, using this standard format. 

=====A Note about Date Format=====

We recommend you use the following formats for date/time: 
  * Date Only: **Month DD YYYY** (ex.May 10 1961)
  * Date & Time: **Month DD YYYY HH:MM:SS GMTOffset** (ex. May 10 1961 00:00:00 GMT-0600)

=====Using the XML File=====
If you installed Timeplot using Installatron on Domain of One's Own, you'll have received a set of sample files that include event data corresponding to President Bush's approval ratings in .xml file. You may replace the event data with your own.

In the Basic Tutorial, we will walk you through how to modify the XML file so that your events appear in your Timeplot.
===== Add A New Line =====

One of the simplest ways to add a new line is to simply copy the one before and then paste it at the bottom of the document. Then change what you need by entering new information or deleting what you don't need. 

===== How to Create a Start and End Date =====

To display the event you need to create at least a a start date. This will create a single line on your Timeplot for an event. Your start and end times also will need to be in Greenwich mean time and the format as listed below. Having an end time is option and if you choose to add one it will create a filled rectangle from the start time to the end time.

<code>

start="Jan 01 2001 8:00:00 GMT-0600"
end="Feb 20 2001 12:00:00 GMT-0600"


</code>
===== Individual Event Colors =====

So in your XML file one of the additional options is to have different colors for events. This can be particularly helpful so that you can group graphs and event with the colors to better illustrate your point about the data. To change the individual even color simply add ' color="(Hex Code)" ' anywhere on the line of the event, but within <event and />.

For example: 

{{:timeplot:xml_colors.png|}}



===== How to Add a Link =====

To add a link to your event all you need to do is to add, " link="ht tp:/ /www. enterwebsite .com/stuffandthings" " refer to the Image below

===== Enter More Information =====



If you would like to enter more information in the square that appears when you click the events, then all you need to do is add a close bracket ">" to the end of your event line. Then add the text you would like to appear followed by a end statement "</event>".

Here is an example of those two options in use:
