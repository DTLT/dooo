Click **install this application** when you're ready. 

A page will appear with a number of settings you can choose/change. The image below shows these settings; here is a rundown of them: 

  * **Location**: You'll need to choose where to install your new application. You can install it at the root of your domain or in a subdomain (which you need to set up first). In addition, you can place your application in a folder (in either your root domain or a subdomain). There may be a default directory entered in the form. You can delete this and choose your own. 
  * **Version Information & License Agreement**: You can leave the version setting as it is, and make sure you've accepted the license agreement. 
  * **Settings**: Make sure you tell us what class this is for and if you're a student/faculty/staff member.
