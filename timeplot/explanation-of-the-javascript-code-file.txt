====== Explanation of the Javascript Code File ======


This tutorial is a walk through of the basic code of the program in the HTML Javascript file. It has been labeled for your convenience. Please ignore areas that are not labeled. Any changes to the code that is unintentional or in unspecified areas can cause it to not work. Please save your work often, so that you can revert to a version that works for ease of use.


To make changes to the code for your timeplot, you will need to click on the individual files and then select **code editor** from the top toolbar of the file manager to edit the files.

A pop up window will appear, leave the settings as is and click edit in the bottom left corner.

===== Graph Code =====

This is the block of code that creates a graph in the Javascript.
To add an Additional Graph you need to insert this block of code below the previous block of graph code and above the code block for the events.

Explanation of Points

  - This is the unique name for the graph line,.
  - This is where the building of the raw data is going to come back. This tells the code what column you want data to come from to make that graph.
  - This is where you can specify the color for the line of your graph to be, using HTML Hexadecimal Code
  - Here you can also specify if you want the graph to have an infill color too. See the following section for changing color.
  - This point is where you can decide if you want your data to be shown when you put your mouse over it. If you want it shown set it to "true," if you do not want it to be shown set it to "false."


===== Editing Colors =====

The program uses hexadecimal code to specify the color to the program of what you want your colors to be. It is very helpful to use another website to help you visualize the colors and get the codes. For example w3schools has a very helpful HTML color picker. You can find the link [[http://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_colorpicker.asp|here]] to get different "Hex" values for colors. 

Line Color: In the previous section it was number 3 in the Graph code to specify the color of the line.

Infill Color: This was number 4 in the previous section where you can change to code to get a different color

===== Editing Events =====

If you would like to change the default color for the events in the timeplot here you can set how you would like to appear. You can later in the XML file change individual ones to create groups of events based on colors.  

Here is the code for events:

===== Adding points on the graph =====

If you would like to dots to your data points to make the data points more pronounced simply add the line 
" dotColor: "(Hex Value)" , " to block of color options in your graph line.

How it should look if you add this line is shown below.

===== How to get data into the program =====

Close to the bottom in this block of text is where you specify to the program where to get the information from. It can use a variety of file types but for this example were are using .txt data. 

{{:timeplot:date_file_location_code.png?|}}

As you can see in the photo above can see there is a lot going on in this small block of code. 
The text underlined in blue **must match exactly** the file type that is in quotes and that is underlined in orange. This is telling the program what the file type is and what the name of the file is called. One thing to note is that the file being named must be in the same folder in the document manager as the program file / index.html file.

The part in yellow is a "Delimiter," this tells the code program where one data entry stops and a new one begins. So what it will do is going into your "data.txt" file and start reading the entries and then once it sees whatever is in that place, right now a comma, it will end that entry and start a new one. 



===== Common Errors =====

For those of you that don't have a background in coding this will be a little bit more difficult, but for those that do this will make sense.

One of the most common errors is forgetting commas during coding. You need to put a comma after each point line in the graph seen here in points 2 and 3. You can remove some lines, but just make sure that the last line doesn't have a comma after it. 

Also make sure that if you have multiple graphs that there is a comma after each block of code. This comma needs to be placed at the end of the two brackets at the end.
