====== Social Media ======

As you begin to build out your digital presence you'll probably start to think about social media in some form. In fact it's likely that you already have at least one, if not more, social media accounts (Facebook being the most popular to date). Everyone uses social media in different ways, and although it's often interesting to see people break the boundaries of the "social norms" of a specific online community, this article will focus more on the accepted use cases for specific social networks and how they can help you build your digital presence. This is by no means a comprehensive "How To" of Twitter or Facebook, but a good starting guide to think about where you best fit in to these online communities.

===== Facebook =====

The majority of folks that will read this likely have a [[http://www.facebook.com | Facebook]] account. With over 1 billion active users it's by far one of the more popular social networks. Many treat Facebook as a semi-personal space, one reserved for family and friends to share photos and highlights of what's happening in their lives. Facebook also supports "Groups" for sharing amongst a smaller set of individuals regularly, and "Pages" which are less personal and more public-facing profiles meant for organizations and businesses. There are plenty of applications that make it easy to publish a link to the work you do on your blog and your participation in other networks back into your Facebook profile. In general it's a good practice and can often lead to interesting conversations with different groups of folks. This practice of publishing elsewhere and then feeding into Facebook is desired over the alternative, using Facebook for all content and then pushing it out to other communities. The main reason for this is that privacy concerns over how different people can view content on Facebook have changed often enough to leave users concerned. There's also never any certainty of sustainability with any of these social networks (remember MySpace or Friendster?) no matter how popular, so publishing in your own space and then pushing out to others makes a lot of sense. The key takeaway is that Facebook is a great personal network and can also be the starting point for some of these larger professional discussions should you decide to use it that way.

===== Twitter =====

While no longer the new kid on the block, [[https://twitter.com/ | Twitter]] has only relatively recently started to gain momentum. It doesn't have nearly the same user base as Facebook (though there are about 500 million accounts to date) and the way people use it is very different. Twitter has focused on the short status message from the start, before Facebook even integrated the idea into their platform. Users are limited to 140 characters. It's a conversational platform for interacting with people. It's used heavily at conferences and many choose this as a social network for really networking with peers and others in their community as well as people they might not ever meet in real life. You can follow as many people as you want and it's a great way of having a stream of information about "what's happening" with people and groups you're interested in. One powerful development of Twitter is that celebrities have begun to embrace it as a way to speak directly to their fans without having the message interpreted through other media and journalism with a slant. The ability to search various topics or hashtags (keywords) and see a running stream of what people are saying about that topic is also a very powerful way of gauging reaction to ideas and events. It's a great idea to experiment with a Twitter account by signing up, adding a profile picture and information about yourself, following a group of people, and interacting with it daily. While the gratification may not be immediate, it's one of those social networks where the more you put into it the more you will get out of it.

===== LinkedIn =====

[[http://www.linkedin.com/ | LinkedIn]] is the professional resumÃ© of social networks. It mixes the ability to keep an updated resume of where you work and what your accomplishments are with a social aspect of having people recommend you and comment on your work. Most users find LinkedIn helpful not as a day-to-day network they use, but rather when they're searching for a new job and want to find people they know that might have connections. The old saying "It's who you know" when finding a job or making a connection is particular relevant here where those connections can be exposed to you ("You know this person who works for the company of one of Bill Gates sons, and the VP went to high school with you).

====Summary=====
As mentioned in the opening paragraph, talking about social media is an ever-changing and moving target and this article can never be truly comprehensive. The goal of A Domain of One's Own is to have you thinking more critically about where you put your content, not that you don't participate in these networks which still have a lot of value, but rather that you own the work you create. Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and others all have different audiences and the more places you push your content to, the more opportunities for discussion and feedback you'll receive. The ability to network with an increased amount of people that isn't reliant on face-to-face meetings is a powerful change in how we interact on the web and the value of it. As you begin to explore social media the best recommendation would be to choose a space you want to explore and really dive in. Follow as many people as possible, talk to them, respond to their work, and you're more likely to get responses in return that start to build that sense of community for you.
