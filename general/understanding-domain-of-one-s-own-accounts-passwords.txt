====== Understanding Domain of One's Own Accounts & Passwords ======

One aspect of Domain of One's Own that users may find a bit complicated at first is understanding the different accounts (and associated passwords) that you can manage as part of your participation in the project. This article outlines the types of accounts that you are likely to have and what they are for

===== Your Domain of One's Own Account =====

Starting in Fall 2014, access to Domain of One's Own has been dramatically simplified. You can now get access to your account using your UMW network id/password. Start by going to [[http://umwdomains.com|umwdomains.com]] and clicking the "Login/Signup" button. You'll be prompted on the page to enter your UMW netid and password. 

If you are new to Domain of One's Own, you'll be prompted to choose a domain. 

If you already have a Domain of One's Own account, you'll be immediately redirected to your cPanel Dashboard. This is the space where you can complete the following types of tasks:

  * install Web applications, like WordPress
  * setup subdomains
  * set up email addresses
  * set up FTP accounts
  * access the built-in File Manager

===== Your Application Administrator Accounts =====

Every time you install a new application in cPanel, an Administrator Account for that application will be created. You will likely use these accounts very often -- every time you need to login to your application to manage the associated Web site, you will use this account. 

For example, if you install WordPress to manage your Web site, every time you need to add content to WordPress, change your theme, approve comments, etc. you will use this account to login. 

Usually, you will be given the opportunity to choose the userid and password for that account. We recommend choosing something that you are likely to remember but that is [[http://lifehacker.com/184773/geek-to-live--choose-and-remember-great-passwords|strong and secure]]. 

Upon installation, you will likely receive an email confirming the userid/password combination you chose. It will also have information about how to access the login page for that application. You may wish to make sure you don't delete this message. 

Depending on the application you're working with, managing and resetting the password for this account will vary. If you've used Installatron to install the application, however, you can always review the account credentials: 

-Login to cPanel. 
-Click the Installatron icon. 
-Find the application you installed under **My Applications**. 
-Click the **Edit** button (this looks like a blue wrench). 
-Scroll down to find the Administrator Username and Password. 

In addition, most applications should have some kind of password reset link on the login page. 

===== Other Types of Accounts =====

In addition, there are a few other kinds of accounts you may have as part of Domain of One's Own (if you choose to use these services): 

* Email: If you set up an email address at your domain, you will have an account associated with this. 
* FTP: If you set up FTP on your account, you will need to set up an account. 
* Application User Accounts: In addition to the Administrator Account that you set up when installing an application, most applications will also let you set up user accounts for other individuals.
