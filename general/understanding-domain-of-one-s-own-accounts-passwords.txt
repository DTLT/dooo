====== Understanding Domain of One's Own Accounts & Passwords ======

One aspect of Domain of One's Own that users may find a bit complicated at first is understanding the different accounts (and associated passwords) that you can manage as part of your participation in the project. This article outlines the types of accounts that you are likely to have, what they are for, and how you go about resetting passwords on each of them.

===== Your Client Account =====

Before you can even sign-up on Domain of Own's Own, you must have an account in our Client System. This account is used by you initially for only one purpose: signing up for your domain and hosting. In addition, at some point in the future (usually upon graduating or leaving UMW), you may need to login to this account again in order to transfer your domain so that you take over ownership of it. 

To access your Client Account: 

* If it is your first time in the Client System, go to http://umwdomamins.com/support and enter your UMW email address under **First time here**? 
* If you have already registered your domain and you are logging into the Client System in order to transfer your domain so that you can take ownership for it, go to https://umwdomains.com/support/clientarea.php. 

The first time you access your Client Account, you will set a password for it. On subsequent logins, you can use that same password. If you forget your password, you can go to https://umwdomains.com/support/clientarea.php and click the **Request a Password Reset** link. 

**Bottom Line:** You MUST use this account at least once to sign-up for Domain of One's Own. You will probably never need to access it again until you graduate or leave UMW and need to transfer your domain so that you can take ownership of it. 

===== Your cPanel Account =====

When you first sign-up for your domain and hosting, an account will be generated that provides you with access to your slice of the Domain of One's Own Web server. You will access this account to complete the following types of tasks: 

* install Web applications, like WordPress 
* setup subdomains
* set up email addresses
* set up FTP accounts
* access the built-in File Manager

You will likely access this space more frequently than your Client Account (see above), but not as frequently as your Application Accounts (see below). 

The login details for your cPanel account will be sent to you when you sign up for a domain and hosting. The subject of the email will be "New Account Information." To access your cPanel Account go to http://cpanel.umwdomains.com. You can use the credentials provided in the New Account Information email to  login. 

If you need to reset your cPanel account login/password, go to http://cpanel.umwdomains.com and click the **Reset password** link.  

Once you are in cPanel, you can always change your password by clicking the **Change Password** icon (in the **Preferences** panel). 

===== Your Application Administrator Accounts =====

Every time you install a new application in cPanel, an Administrator Account for that application will be created. You will likely use these accounts very often -- every time you need to login to your application to manage the associated Web site, you will use this account. 

For example, if you install WordPress to manage your Web site, every time you need to add content to WordPress, change your theme, approve comments, etc. you will use this account to login. 

Usually, you will be given the opportunity to choose the userid and password for that account. We recommend choosing something that you are likely to remember but that is [[http://lifehacker.com/184773/geek-to-live--choose-and-remember-great-passwords|strong and secure]]. 

Upon installation, you will likely receive an email confirming the userid/password combination you chose. It will also have information about how to access the login page for that application. You may wish to make sure you don't delete this message. 

Depending on the application you're working with, managing and resetting the password for this account will vary. If you've used Installatron to install the application, however, you can always review the account credentials: 

-Login to cPanel. 
-Click the Installatron icon. 
-Find the application you installed under **My Applications**. 
-Click the **Edit** button (this looks like a blue wrench). 
-Scroll down to find the Administrator Username and Password. 

In addition, most applications should have some kind of password reset link on the login page. 

===== Other Types of Accounts =====

In addition to the three account types outlined above, there are a few other kinds of accounts you may have as part of Domain of One's Own: 

* Email: If you set up an email address at your domain, you will have an account associated with this. 
* FTP: If you set up FTP on your account, you will need to set up an account. 
* Application User Accounts: In addition to the Administrator Account that you set up when installing an application, most applications will also let you set up user accounts.
