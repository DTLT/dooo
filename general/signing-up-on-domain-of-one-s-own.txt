====== Signing up on Domain of One's Own ======

Getting started on Domain of One's Own is a straightforward process. 

===== Getting a Client Account =====

The first step is determining that you have an account in our client system that allows you to then signup for a domain and hosting. Here are some general guidelines to determine if you have an account: 

  *If you are freshman at the University who started Fall 2013 or later, you should automatically be added to our system. 
  *If you are not a freshman who started Fall 2013 or later, an account will need to be created for you. You can [[http://umwdomains.com/#contact|request an account by filing out this form]]. In addition, students in classes that are participating in Domain of One's Own will have accounts created for them. 
  *If you are a faculty or staff member, you will need to [[http://umwdomains.com/#contact|request an account by filling out this form]].

If you request an account, you'll receive an email when it's been created. If you're in a class that's participating in Domain of One's Own, your professor will let you know when your account is created and you can signup. 

===== Reviewing the Guidelines =====

Once you know you have an account, we recommend that you [[http://umwdomains.com/start|review some guidelines and information about the project. ]] In particular, you should review our information about [[general:choosing-a-domain-name|choosing a domain name]].

  - You will receive an email with a link to set a password for your client account. Follow that link and set-up your password. When you're done, a link will appear that you can click to proceed to the client area. 
  - Inside the client system, a box will appear in the middle of the screen with a link to get started. Click on this to proceed with setting up your domain and hosting.

  - When you've found an available domain that you want, click the button labeled **Click to Continue**. 
  - You'll next seen an "Order Summary" showing the domain you chose as well as the default hosting plan that we'll be giving you. Review your order and click the **Checkout** button.
  - On the "Checkout" page that appears next, you'll be asked to review and agree to the Domain of One's Own **Terms of Service**. When you're done click the **Complete Order** button. 
  - It can take 20-30 seconds for your order to complete. When it's done, a confirmation page will appear. 

After you complete your order, you will receive an email with the subject "New Account Information." This contains important information about your actual hosting account/password and your new domain. We recommend saving this somewhere where you'll be able to find it again. 

That's it. You're now the proud owner of your own domain and Web hosting space!
