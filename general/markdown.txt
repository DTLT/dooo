#Markdown Syntax
Markdown syntax was created by John Gruber in 2004 as a lightweight method of writing HTML documents. It has gained in popularity with its adoption into software and web-based programs like Movable Type, GitHub, and WordPress. Full documentation on the syntax is available at [[http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax|Daring Fireball]]. We use a plugin that allows Markdown syntax here on the Domain of One's Own Documentation Wiki. This page is a sampling of some of the more common types of markup and how you would write them using Markdown.
